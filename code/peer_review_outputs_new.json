        "title": "REWARD-FREE CURRICULA FOR TRAINING ROBUST WORLD MODELS",
        "abstract": "There has been a recent surge of interest in developing generally-capable agents that can adapt to new tasks without additional training in the environment. Learning world models from reward-free exploration is a promising approach, and enables policies to be trained using imagined experience for new tasks. However, achieving a general agent requires robustness across different environments. In this work, we address the novel problem of generating curricula in the reward-free setting to train robust world models. We consider robustness in terms of minimax regret over all environment instantiations and show that the minimax regret can be connected to minimising the maximum error in the world model across environment instances. This result informs our algorithm, WAKER: Weighted Acquisition of Knowledge across Environments for Robustness. WAKER selects environments for data collection based on the estimated error of the world model for each environment. Our experiments demonstrate that WAKER outperforms several baselines, resulting in improved robustness, efficiency, and generalisation.",

Shah et al.***\n===========================================================\n\nIntroduction:\nThe study by Shah et al. explores the self-regulation of emotions and cognitive performance under stress and relaxation. The researchers examine the relationships between emotional regulation and cognitive processes under different emotional states. The study contributes to our understanding of the complex interplay between emotions and cognition.\n\nMethodology:\nThe study employed an experiment-based approach, where participants completed an emotional regulation task while experiencing either stress or relaxation. The task consisted of identifying emotions from facial expressions and rating their intensity. The researchers used an emotional regulation strategy training program to enhance participants' ability to self-regulate their emotions. The sample consisted of 120 participants, who were randomly assigned to either the stress or relaxation condition. The study found significant differences between the two conditions, indicating that emotional regulation strategies were more beneficial under stress than relaxation.\n\nCritique:\nThe study has several strengths, including the innovative emotional regulation strategy training program and the well-controlled experiment design. However, there are some limitations and areas for improvement:\n\n1.  **Small sample size:** The study's sample size of 120 participants is relatively small, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Future studies could benefit from larger samples to increase the statistical power and reliability of the results.\n\n2.  **Limited emotional regulation strategies:** The study employed only two emotional regulation strategies, which may not capture the complexity of human emotional regulation. Future studies could explore additional strategies and their effects on cognitive performance.\n\n3.  **Stress and relaxation manipulations:** The study's stress and relaxation manipulations were based on self-reported measures of stress and relaxation. While these measures can provide valuable insights, they may not be as objective as other methods, such as physiological measures. Future studies could consider incorporating additional measures to validate the manipulations.\n\n4.  **Cognitive performance measures:** The study used rating scales to measure cognitive performance. While rating scales can be useful, they may not provide as detailed or nuanced information as other measures, such as performance on specific cognitive tasks. Future studies could consider incorporating additional measures to provide more comprehensive insights into cognitive performance.\n\nConclusion:\nThe study by Shah et al. provides valuable insights into the self-regulation of emotions and cognitive performance under stress and relaxation. While there are some limitations, the study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of the complex interplay between emotions and cognition. Future studies could build on the current study by exploring additional emotional regulation strategies, incorporating additional measures of stress and relaxation, and examining the effects of emotional regulation on cognitive performance under different contexts.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n*   **Future studies:** Consider incorporating additional emotional regulation strategies and measures of stress and relaxation to increase the complexity and validity of the findings.\n*   **Cognitive performance measures:** Incorporate additional measures of cognitive performance to provide more comprehensive insights into the effects of emotional regulation on cognitive performance.\n\nOverall, the study by Shah et al. contributes to our understanding of the complex interplay between emotions and cognition. While there are some limitations, the study's findings have significant implications for our understanding of the self-regulation of emotions and cognitive performance under stress and relaxation.",

        "abstract": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, UCL, London, United Kingdom Microsoft Research, Cambridge ABSTRACT Scientific discovery hinges on the effective integration of metadata, which refers to a set of conceptual operations such as determining what information is relevant for inquiry, and data, which encompasses physical operations such as observation and experimentation. This paper introduces the Causal Modelling Agent (CMA), a novel framework that synergizes the metadata-based reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the data-driven modelling of Deep Structural Causal Models (DSCMs) for the task of causal discovery. We evaluate the CMA\u2019s performance on a number of benchmarks, as well as on the real-world task of modelling the clinical and radiological phenotype of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD). Our experimental results indicate that the CMA can outperform previous purely data-driven or metadata-driven approaches to causal discovery. In our real-world application, we use the CMA to derive new insights into the causal relationships among biomarkers of AD.",

Dr. John Smith, Department of Infectious Diseases, University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)\n2. Dr. Maria Rodriguez, Department of Vaccine Research, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)\n3. Dr. David Lee, Department of Immunology, University of Illinois\n\n**Paper Summary:**\nThe authors report the development of a novel influenza A (H7N9) vaccine candidate using adenoviral vector technology. The adenoviral vector was derived from a common cold virus, Adenovirus type 5, which was modified to produce a vaccine antigen that induces neutralizing antibody responses. The vaccine candidate was evaluated in mice for its safety, efficacy, and immune responses. The results showed that the vaccine candidate was safe, induced strong neutralizing antibody responses, and protected against H7N9 infection in mice.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n**Overall Impression:**\nThe manuscript presents an interesting approach to developing a novel influenza A (H7N9) vaccine candidate using adenoviral vector technology. The authors have demonstrated a clear understanding of the vaccine development process, including the use of adenoviral vectors as a vaccine delivery system.\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. The authors have successfully demonstrated the safety, efficacy, and immune responses of the vaccine candidate in mice, which is a critical step in vaccine development.\n2. The use of adenoviral vectors as a vaccine delivery system is an attractive approach, as they can be easily produced in large quantities, are highly contagious, and can induce strong immune responses.\n3. The authors have provided a clear explanation of the vaccine antigen production process, which is essential for vaccine development.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. The study was conducted in mice, which may limit the translational relevance of the results to humans. Further studies in non-human primates or human clinical trials are necessary to confirm the safety, efficacy, and immune responses of the vaccine candidate in humans.\n2. The authors did not provide detailed information on the vaccine antigen production process, including the specific Adenovirus type 5 strain used, the expression vector used, and the optimization of the antigen expression process.\n3. The manuscript lacks a comprehensive discussion on the potential risks associated with adenoviral vector technology, including the risk of vaccine-related adverse events, such as injection site reactions, fever, or systemic reactions.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvements:**\n1. The authors should conduct studies in non-human primates to confirm the safety, efficacy, and immune responses of the vaccine candidate in humans.\n2. The authors should provide detailed information on the vaccine antigen production process, including the specific Adenovirus type 5 strain used, the expression vector used, and the optimization of the antigen expression process.\n3. The authors should conduct a comprehensive review of the potential risks associated with adenoviral vector technology, including the risk of vaccine-related adverse events.\n4. The authors should consider conducting a phase I clinical trial to assess the safety, efficacy, and immune responses of the vaccine candidate in humans.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nBased on the manuscript, I recommend that the authors revise the manuscript to address the weaknesses mentioned above. The authors should also consider conducting additional studies to confirm the safety, efficacy, and immune responses of the vaccine candidate in humans. The manuscript is well-structured, well-written, and presents an interesting approach to developing a novel influenza A (H7N9) vaccine candidate. With revisions, the manuscript will be of high quality and will contribute significantly to the field of vaccine development.\n\n**Rating:**\nI give this manuscript a rating of 7 out of 10.

        "abstract": "Our understanding of the visual world is centered around various concept axes, characterizing different aspects of visual entities. While different concept axes can be easily specified by language, e.g., color, the exact visual nuances along each axis often exceed the limitations of linguistic articulations, e.g., a particular style of painting. In this work, our goal is to learn a language-informed visual concept representation, by simply distilling large pre-trained vision-language models. Specifically, we train a set of concept encoders to encode the information pertinent to a set of language-informed concept axes, with an objective of reproducing the input image through a pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) model. To encourage better disentanglement of different concept encoders, we anchor the concept embeddings to a set of text embeddings obtained from a pre-trained Visual Question Answering (VQA) model. At inference time, the model extracts concept embeddings along various axes from new test images, which can be remixed to generate images with novel compositions of visual concepts. With a lightweight test-time finetuning procedure, it can also generalize to novel concepts unseen at training. Project page at https://cs.stanford.edu/ \u0303yzzhang/projects/concept-axes.",

By knowledge distillation, the former stage of Rapper infuses rationale-prompting via large language models (LLMs), encouraging the rationales supported by language-based facts. As for the latter stage, a unique Reinforcement Learning from NLE Feedback (RLNF) is introduced for injecting visual facts into NLE generation. Finally, quantitative and qualitative experiments on two VL-NLE benchmarks show that RAPPER surpasses state-of-the-art VQA-NLE methods while providing plausible and faithful NLE.",

        "abstract": "We present MovingParts, a NeRF-based method for dynamic scene reconstruction and part discovery. We consider motion as an important cue for identifying parts, that all particles on the same part share the common motion pattern. From the perspective of fluid simulation, existing deformation-based methods for dynamic NeRF can be seen as parameterizing the scene motion under the Eulerian view, i.e., focusing on specific locations in space through which the fluid flows as time passes. However, it is intractable to extract the motion of constituting objects or parts using the Eulerian view representation. In this work, we introduce the dual Lagrangian view and enforce representations under the Eulerian/Lagrangian views to be cycle-consistent. Under the Lagrangian view, we parameterize the scene motion by tracking the trajectory of particles on objects. The Lagrangian view makes it convenient to discover parts by factorizing the scene motion as a composition of part-level rigid motions. Experimentally, our method can achieve fast and high-quality dynamic scene reconstruction from even a single moving camera, and the induced part-based representation allows direct applications of part tracking, animation, 3D scene editing, etc.",

        "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL), which aims to fully explore offline datasets for training without interaction with environments, has attracted growing recent attention. A major challenge for the real-world application of offline RL stems from the robustness against state observation perturbations, e.g., as a result of sensor errors or adversarial attacks. Unlike online robust RL, agents cannot be adversarially trained in the offline setting. In this work, we propose Diffusion Model-Based Predictor (DMBP) in a new framework that recovers the actual states with conditional diffusion models for state-based RL tasks. To mitigate the error accumulation issue in model-based estimation resulting from the classical training of conventional diffusion models, we propose a non-Markovian training objective to minimize the sum entropy of denoised states in RL trajectory. Experiments on standard benchmark problems demonstrate that DMBP can significantly enhance the robustness of existing offline RL algorithms against different scales of random noises and adversarial attacks on state observations. Further, the proposed framework can effectively deal with incomplete state observations with random combinations of multiple unobserved dimensions in the test. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/zhyang2226/DMBP",

Moreover, direct transplantation of protein design methodologies into RNA design fails to achieve satisfactory outcomes although sharing similar structural components. In this study, we aim to systematically construct a data-driven RNA design pipeline. We crafted a large, well-curated benchmark dataset and designed a comprehensive structural modeling approach to represent the complex RNA tertiary structure. More importantly, we proposed a hierarchical data-efficient representation learning framework that learns structural representations through contrastive learning at both clusterlevel and sample-level to fully leverage the limited data. By constraining data representations within a limited hyperspherical space, the intrinsic relationships between data points could be explicitly imposed. Moreover, we incorporated extracted secondary structures with base pairs as prior knowledge to facilitate the RNA design process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, providing a reliable baseline for future RNA design tasks.

        "abstract": "This study addresses the challenge of inaccurate gradients in computing the empirical Fisher Information Matrix during neural network pruning. We introduce SWAP, a formulation of Entropic Wasserstein regression (EWR) for pruning, capitalizing on the geometric properties of the optimal transport problem. The \u201cswap\u201d of the commonly used linear regression with the EWR in optimization is analytically demonstrated to offer noise mitigation effects by incorporating neighborhood interpolation across data points with only marginal additional computational cost. The unique strength of SWAP is its intrinsic ability to balance noise reduction and covariance information preservation effectively. Extensive experiments performed on various networks and datasets show comparable performance of SWAP with state-of-the-art (SoTA) network pruning algorithms. Our proposed method outperforms the SoTA when the network size or the target sparsity is large, the gain is even larger with the existence of noisy gradients, possibly from noisy data, analog memory, or adversarial attacks. Notably, our proposed method achieves a gain of 6% improvement in accuracy and 8% improvement in testing loss for MobileNetV1 with less than one-fourth of the network parameters remaining.",

We analyze the trends and patterns in drought events over the past 50 years using a combination of observational data and climate models. Our results show a significant increase in drought frequency and severity, particularly in the African and Australian regions. We also identify key factors contributing to these changes, including changes in precipitation patterns and increased temperature variability. Our study highlights the importance of considering the complexity and variability of climate change impacts when developing mitigation and adaptation strategies.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Overall Impression:**\nThis paper presents a well-structured and comprehensive analysis of the effects of climate change on global droughts using a multi-model approach. The authors provide a clear and concise overview of the research question, methodology, and results, making it accessible to a broad audience.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. **Methodological approach:** The authors' use of a multi-model approach is a significant strength, as it provides a more comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships between climate change and droughts.\n2. **Data quality and availability:** The authors have utilized a combination of observational data and climate models, ensuring that their results are based on robust and well-validated data.\n3. **Clear and concise writing style:** The authors have written the paper in a clear and concise manner, making it easy to understand and interpret the results.\n\n**Limitations and Critiques:**\n\n1. **Model bias and uncertainty:** While the authors have acknowledged the potential biases and uncertainties in the climate models, they could have provided more detailed information on these issues, such as model-specific sensitivities and uncertainty estimates.\n2. **Data aggregation and averaging:** The authors have aggregated and averaged the data across models, which may mask important differences and nuances in the results.\n3. **Regional focus:** The study focuses primarily on African and Australian regions, which may not be representative of all global droughts. A more comprehensive analysis that includes a broader set of regions would strengthen the paper.\n4. **Time period:** The study only examines the past 50 years, which may not capture the full extent of climate change impacts on droughts. A longer time period would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the trends and patterns.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Provide more detailed information on model bias and uncertainty:** The authors should provide more detailed information on the potential biases and uncertainties in the climate models, including model-specific sensitivities and uncertainty estimates.\n2. **Include a more comprehensive set of regions:** The authors should include a broader set of regions in their analysis to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the global drought impacts.\n3. **Examine longer time periods:** The authors should examine longer time periods to capture the full extent of climate change impacts on droughts.\n4. **Consider additional factors:** The authors could consider additional factors, such as land use changes, soil moisture, and atmospheric circulation patterns, to further understand the complex relationships between climate change and droughts.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this paper presents a well-structured and comprehensive analysis of the effects of climate change on global droughts using a multi-model approach. While the authors have highlighted the importance of considering the complexity and variability of climate change impacts, they could strengthen the paper by providing more detailed information on model bias and uncertainty, including a more comprehensive set of regions and longer time periods.

        "title": "DRM: MASTERING VISUAL REINFORCEMENT LEARN-",
        "abstract": "Visual reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in continuous control tasks. Despite its progress, current algorithms are still unsatisfactory in virtually every aspect of the performance such as sample efficiency, asymptotic performance, and their robustness to the choice of random seeds. In this paper, we identify a major shortcoming in existing visual RL methods that is the agents often exhibit sustained inactivity during early training, thereby limiting their ability to explore effectively. Expanding upon this crucial observation, we additionally unveil a significant correlation between the agents\u2019 inclination towards motorically inactive exploration and the absence of neuronal activity within their policy networks. To quantify this inactivity, we adopt dormant ratio (Sokar et al., 2023) as a metric to measure inactivity in the RL agent\u2019s network. Empirically, we also recognize that the dormant ratio can act as a standalone indicator of an agent\u2019s activity level, regardless of the received reward signals. Leveraging the aforementioned insights, we introduce DrM , a method that uses three core mechanisms to guide agents\u2019 exploration-exploitation trade-offs by actively minimizing the dormant ratio. Experiments demonstrate that DrM achieves significant improvements in sample efficiency and asymptotic performance with no broken seeds (76 seeds in total) across three continuous control benchmark environments, including DeepMind Control Suite, MetaWorld, and Adroit. Most importantly, DrM is the first model-free algorithm that consistently solves tasks in both the Dog and Manipulator domains from the DeepMind Control Suite as well as three dexterous hand manipulation tasks without demonstrations in Adroit, all based on pixel observations. 1 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Training Progress 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Ep iso de R ew ar d Deepmind Control Suite (8 Hard Tasks) 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Training Progress 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Su cc es s R at e MetaWorld (8 Tasks) 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Training Progress 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Su cc es s R at e Adroit (3 Tasks) DrM DrQ-v2 ALIX TACO Figure 1: Success rate and episode reward as a function of training progress for each of the three domains that we consider (Deepmind Control Suite, MetaWorld, Adroit).

        "abstract": "In the pursuit of reducing the number of trainable parameters in deep transformer networks, we employ Reinforcement Learning to dynamically select layers during training and tie them together. Every few iterations, the RL agent is asked whether to train each layer i independently or to copy the weights of a previous layer j < i. This facilitates weight sharing, reduces the number of trainable parameters, and also serves as an effective regularization technique. Experimental evaluations validate that our model modestly outperforms the baseline transformer model with regard to perplexity and drastically reduces the number of trainable parameters. In particular, the memory consumption during training is up to one order of magnitude less than the conventional training method.",

This study proposes a novel approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases using microRNA-based gene editing. We used CRISPR-Cas9 system to introduce microRNAs (miRNAs) into neurons, which can modulate the expression of target genes involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Our results show that miRNA-based gene editing can effectively reduce the expression of disease-associated genes and improve neuronal function in vitro and in vivo models. These findings suggest that microRNA-based gene editing may be a promising therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Introduction:**\nThe introduction is clear and concise, providing an overview of the importance of developing novel therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative diseases. However, it would be beneficial to provide more context on the current state of research in this field and the limitations of existing treatments.\n\n**Methods:**\nThe methods section provides a detailed description of the CRISPR-Cas9 system and miRNA-based gene editing approach. However, it would be helpful to provide more information on the specific miRNAs used, the target genes, and the in vitro and in vivo models employed.

In my review, I will critically evaluate the paper's methodology, results, and overall contributions to the field of climate change and food security.\n\n**Methodology:**\n\nThe authors conducted a comprehensive review of empirical evidence on the effects of climate change on global food security. They identified 25 peer-reviewed articles and 15 grey literature sources, which they categorized into three main themes: (1) climate change impacts on crop yields, (2) climate change impacts on agricultural productivity, and (3) climate change impacts on food price volatility. The authors used a mixed methods approach, combining quantitative and qualitative analysis to examine the relationships between climate change, food security, and economic indicators.\n\nWhile the authors' review of empirical evidence is thorough, I have some concerns regarding the selection of sources. The authors primarily focused on peer-reviewed articles, which may limit the scope of the review. Additionally, the authors did not provide a clear description of the grey literature sources they included, making it difficult to evaluate the credibility and relevance of these sources.\n\n**Results:**\n\nThe authors found that climate change has significant impacts on global food security, including reduced crop yields, decreased agricultural productivity, and increased food price volatility. They also identified several key factors that contribute to these impacts, such as rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events.\n\nThe authors' results are consistent with existing literature on the topic, but they do not provide any new insights or novel perspectives. The review is largely based on established knowledge, and the authors' analysis is not particularly nuanced or innovative.\n\n**Contributions:**\n\nThe authors' review provides a comprehensive overview of the empirical evidence on the effects of climate change on global food security. However, their contributions to the field of climate change and food security are somewhat limited. The authors do not offer any new theoretical frameworks or policy recommendations, and their analysis is largely focused on summarizing existing knowledge.\n\nIn conclusion, the paper \"Investigating the Effects of Climate Change on Global Food Security: A Review of Empirical Evidence\" by Dr. Maria Rodriguez, Dr. John Lee, and Dr. Emily Chen is a thorough review of empirical evidence on the topic. However, the authors' selection of sources and lack of innovation in their analysis limit the paper's contributions to the field. I recommend that the authors revise the paper to address these limitations and provide more nuanced and novel insights into the effects of climate change on global food security.\n\n**Rating:** 6/10\n\n**Suggestions for Revision:**\n\n* Expand the review to include more grey literature sources and a wider range of empirical evidence.\n* Develop a more nuanced and innovative analysis of the relationships between climate change, food security, and economic indicators.\n* Offer new theoretical frameworks or policy recommendations to address the impacts of climate change on global food security.\n* Improve the clarity and organization of the paper's methodology, results, and discussion sections.\n* Consider incorporating more case studies or examples to illustrate the practical implications of the authors' analysis.",

        "title": "ENHANCING NEURAL SUBSET SELECTION: INTEGRAT-",
        "abstract": "Learning neural subset selection tasks, such as compound selection in AI-aided drug discovery, have become increasingly pivotal across diverse applications. The existing methodologies in the field primarily concentrate on constructing models that capture the relationship between utility function values and subsets within their respective supersets. However, these approaches tend to overlook the valuable information contained within the superset when utilizing neural networks to model set functions. In this work, we address this oversight by adopting a probabilistic perspective. Our theoretical findings demonstrate that when the target value is conditioned on both the input set and subset, it is essential to incorporate an invariant sufficient statistic of the superset into the subset of interest for effective learning. This ensures that the output value remains invariant to permutations of the subset and its corresponding superset, enabling identification of the specific superset from which the subset originated. Motivated by these insights, we propose a simple yet effective information aggregation module designed to merge the representations of subsets and supersets from a permutation invariance perspective. Comprehensive empirical evaluations across diverse tasks and datasets validate the enhanced efficacy of our approach over conventional methods, underscoring the practicality and potency of our proposed strategies in real-world contexts.",

Lee, S. Kim, Y. Park, J. Lee, M. Kim\n\n**Journal:** Journal of Renewable Materials\n\n**Abstract:**\nThis study investigates the effects of varying temperature regimens on the yield of bio-based polyurethane foams. The foams were produced using a reaction-based method, where polyol (urea-based) reactants were mixed with isocyanates in the presence of a catalyst. The temperature regimens tested were: (a) ambient temperature (20\u00b0C); (b) moderate temperature (30\u00b0C); (c) high temperature (40\u00b0C); (d) extreme temperature (50\u00b0C). The results show that the yield of the foams was significantly affected by the temperature regime, with the highest yield observed at 30\u00b0C. The authors conclude that the optimal temperature regime for producing bio-based polyurethane foams is 30\u00b0C.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Overall Impression:**\nThis study presents an investigation into the effects of temperature regimens on the yield of bio-based polyurethane foams. The authors employed a reaction-based method to produce the foams, using polyol (urea-based) reactants mixed with isocyanates in the presence of a catalyst. The results indicate a significant impact of temperature on foam yield, with the highest yield observed at 30\u00b0C.\n\n**Strengths:**\nThe study's focus on the effects of temperature regimens on the yield of bio-based polyurethane foams is relevant to the field of renewable materials. The use of a reaction-based method to produce the foams is also noteworthy, as this approach can be more efficient than traditional methods. The authors' conclusion that the optimal temperature regime for producing bio-based polyurethane foams is 30\u00b0C is also a valuable contribution to the field.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\nOne potential weakness of the study is the small sample size. The authors tested only four temperature regimens, with a total of four foams produced. This may not be representative of the larger population of bio-based polyurethane foams, and may limit the generalizability of the results. Additionally, the study does not provide detailed information on the properties of the foams, such as density, compressive strength, or thermal insulation properties.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\nTo strengthen the study, the authors could increase the sample size to include more temperature regimens or foams. This would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of temperature on foam yield. The authors could also conduct a more detailed analysis of the properties of the foams, including measurements of density, compressive strength, thermal insulation properties, or other relevant properties.\n\n**Critical Comments:**\nThe authors' conclusion that the optimal temperature regime for producing bio-based polyurethane foams is 30\u00b0C is based on a single experimental condition. This may not be representative of the larger population of bio-based polyurethane foams, as the optimal temperature regime may vary depending on the specific application or industry. Additionally, the study does not provide information on the catalyst used, the type of polyol or isocyanates used, or other relevant factors that may affect the yield of the foams.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nThe study contributes to the understanding of the effects of temperature regimens on the yield of bio-based polyurethane foams. However, the results should be viewed with caution due to the small sample size. The authors should increase the sample size, conduct a more detailed analysis of the properties of the foams, and provide more information on the catalyst, polyol, or isocyanates used. With these improvements, the study could provide more robust results that contribute to the development of more efficient methods for producing bio-based polyurethane foams.\n\n**Rating:**\nOverall, I give this study a rating of 7 out of 10. While the study presents some valuable insights into the effects of temperature regimens on the yield of bio-based polyurethane foams, the results are somewhat limited by the small sample size. With further improvements, the study could contribute more significantly to the field of renewable materials.",

        "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are attracting growing interest for their energyefficient computing when implemented on neuromorphic hardware. However, directly training SNNs, even adopting batch normalization (BN), is highly challenging due to their non-differentiable activation function and the temporally delayed accumulation of outputs over time. For SNN training, this temporal accumulation gives rise to Temporal Covariate Shifts (TCS) along the temporal dimension, a phenomenon that would become increasingly pronounced with layer-wise computations across multiple layers and multiple time-steps. In this paper, we introduce TAB (Temporal Accumulated Batch Normalization), a novel SNN batch normalization method that addresses the temporal covariate shift issue by aligning with neuron dynamics (specifically the accumulated membrane potential) and utilizing temporal accumulated statistics for data normalization. Within its framework, TAB effectively encapsulates the historical temporal dependencies that underlie the membrane potential accumulation process, thereby establishing a natural connection between neuron dynamics and TAB batch normalization. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and DVS-CIFAR10 show that our TAB method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.",

The authors conduct a comprehensive review of empirical evidence, synthesizing findings on climate-related changes in crop yields, water usage, and food prices to better understand the implications for food security.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. The authors provide a thorough review of existing literature, highlighting the importance of considering multiple factors that influence food security in the face of climate change.\n2. The paper's structure is well-organized, allowing readers to easily follow the authors' argument and understand the relationships between climate change, crop yields, water usage, and food prices.\n3. The authors' use of empirical evidence is impressive, drawing on a wide range of studies to support their claims.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. While the authors acknowledge the complexity of climate change's impact on food security, they could have explored the nuances of these interactions more deeply, providing a more detailed analysis of the relationships between climate change, crop yields, water usage, and food prices.\n2. The authors' discussion of adaptation and mitigation strategies is brief, and more attention should be devoted to exploring effective solutions to address the food security implications of climate change.\n3. The paper could benefit from more explicit discussion of the limitations of the empirical evidence, highlighting potential biases and areas for future research.\n\n**Methodological Concerns:**\n\n1. The authors' review of empirical evidence is based on a wide range of studies, but it is unclear whether they have considered the quality and heterogeneity of these studies, which could impact the overall validity of their conclusions.\n2. The authors' use of statistical models to analyze the relationships between climate change, crop yields, water usage, and food prices is not explicitly described, which could limit the transparency and reproducibility of their findings.\n\n**Future Research Directions:**\n\n1. The authors should explore the role of climate change in exacerbating existing social and economic inequalities in food access, highlighting the need for targeted interventions to address these issues.\n2. Further research should focus on developing more effective adaptation and mitigation strategies, considering the specific needs of different regions and communities.\n3. The authors should investigate the impact of climate change on food security in different policy contexts, examining the effectiveness of various policy interventions.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. The authors should consider revising their paper to address the limitations of their review, explicitly discussing the potential biases and areas for future research.\n2. The authors should provide more explicit details on their statistical models and methods, ensuring transparency and reproducibility in their analysis.\n3. The authors should engage in more in-depth discussions of adaptation and mitigation strategies, exploring effective solutions to address the food security implications of climate change.\n\n**Rating:**\n\nBased on the review, I would give this paper a rating of 8 out of 10, with the paper demonstrating a strong foundation in the literature and a clear argument, but with opportunities for improvement in addressing the limitations of the empirical evidence and providing more explicit details on statistical models and methods.\n\n**Recommendation for Publication:**\n\nI would recommend that the authors address the weaknesses and concerns outlined in this review, revising their paper to strengthen the empirical evidence, improve the transparency and reproducibility of their analysis, and provide more explicit discussions of adaptation and mitigation strategies. With revisions, I believe the paper has the potential to make a significant contribution to the field of climate change and food security, and I would be happy to recommend it for publication in a top-tier journal.",

        "title": "A UNIFIED SAMPLING FRAMEWORK FOR SOLVER SEARCHING OF DIFFUSION PROBABILISTIC MODELS",
        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the rapid progress and broad application of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs). Sampling from DPMs can be viewed as solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Despite the promising performance, the generation of DPMs usually consumes much time due to the large number of function evaluations (NFE). Though recent works have accelerated the sampling to around 20 steps with high-order solvers, the sample quality with less than 10 NFE can still be improved. In this paper, we propose a unified sampling framework (USF) to study the optional strategies for solver. Under this framework, we further reveal that taking different solving strategies at different timesteps may help further decrease the truncation error, and a carefully designed solver schedule has the potential to improve the sample quality by a large margin. Therefore, we propose a new sampling framework based on the exponential integral formulation that allows free choices of solver strategy at each step and design specific decisions for the framework. Moreover, we propose S, a predictor-based search method that automatically optimizes the solver schedule to get a better time-quality trade-off of sampling. We demonstrate that S can find outstanding solver schedules which outperform the state-of-the-art sampling methods on CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet, and LSUN-Bedroom datasets. Specifically, we achieve 2.69 FID with 10 NFE and 6.86 FID with 5 NFE on CIFAR-10 dataset, outperforming the SOTA method significantly. We further apply S to Stable-Diffusion model and get an acceleration ratio of 2\u00d7, showing the feasibility of sampling in very few steps without retraining the neural network.",

        "abstract": "We study principal-agent problems in which a principal commits to an outcomedependent payment scheme\u2014called contract\u2014in order to induce an agent to take a costly, unobservable action leading to favorable outcomes. We consider a generalization of the classical (single-round) version of the problem in which the principal interacts with the agent by committing to contracts over multiple rounds. The principal has no information about the agent, and they have to learn an optimal contract by only observing the outcome realized at each round. We focus on settings in which the size of the agent\u2019s action space is small. We design an algorithm that learns an approximately-optimal contract with high probability in a number of rounds polynomial in the size of the outcome space, when the number of actions is constant. Our algorithm solves an open problem by Zhu et al. (2023). Moreover, it can also be employed to provide a \u00d5(T ) regret bound in the related online learning setting in which the principal aims at maximizing their cumulative utility over rounds, considerably improving previously-known regret bounds.",

The TQC consists of a 128-qubit array, which is connected by superconducting qubits in a toroidal topology. The authors claim to have performed a series of experiments that demonstrate quantum supremacy, including a 3-day experiment that measures a specific quantum process.\n\n**Methodological Critique:**\n\n1. The authors do not provide sufficient details on their TQC design, including the materials used, fabrication process, and quantum noise modeling. A more detailed description of their TQC design is necessary to fully understand their results.\n2. The authors' measurement protocol is not clearly described, including the specific quantum process being measured. The authors should provide more details on their measurement protocol to ensure that their results are reproducible.\n3. The authors' analysis of their results is not transparent, including a lack of error analysis. The authors should provide a more detailed analysis of their results, including error analysis, to ensure that their results are reliable.\n4. The authors' claim of quantum supremacy is not clearly justified. The authors should provide more evidence to support their claim of quantum supremacy, including a more detailed analysis of their results.\n\n**Discussion of Implications:**\n\nThe authors' claim of quantum supremacy with a large-scale TQC has important implications for quantum computing. If their results are confirmed, it would demonstrate that quantum computers can perform certain tasks much faster than classical computers. This would have significant implications for fields such as cryptography, optimization, and machine learning.\n\nHowever, it is also important to note that the authors' results are not without controversy. The claim of quantum supremacy is not universally accepted, and some experts have questioned the validity of their results. Further research is necessary to fully understand the implications of this result.\n\n**Potential Future Directions:**\n\n1. Further research is necessary to understand the error correction mechanisms in TQC's.\n2. The authors should provide more details on their TQC design, including materials used, fabrication process, and quantum noise modeling.\n3. The authors should provide more evidence to support their claim of quantum supremacy.\n4. The authors should conduct a more detailed analysis of their results, including error analysis, to ensure that their results are reliable.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.

        "abstract": "Spatio-temporal modeling is foundational for smart city applications, yet it is often hindered by data scarcity in many cities and regions. To bridge this gap, we propose a novel generative pre-training framework, GPD, for spatio-temporal few-shot learning with urban knowledge transfer. Unlike conventional approaches that heavily rely on common feature extraction or intricate few-shot learning designs, our solution takes a novel approach by performing generative pre-training on a collection of neural network parameters optimized with data from source cities. We recast spatio-temporal few-shot learning as pre-training a generative diffusion model, which generates tailored neural networks guided by prompts, allowing for adaptability to diverse data distributions and city-specific characteristics. GPD employs a Transformer-based denoising diffusion model, which is model-agnostic to integrate with powerful spatio-temporal neural networks. By addressing challenges arising from data gaps and the complexity of generalizing knowledge across cities, our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on multiple real-world datasets for tasks such as traffic speed prediction and crowd flow prediction. The implementation of our approach is available: https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/GPD.",

        "abstract": "Recent advances in high-fidelity virtual environments serve as one of the major driving forces for building intelligent embodied agents to perceive, reason and interact with the physical world. Typically, these environments remain unchanged unless agents interact with them. However, in real-world scenarios, agents might also face dynamically changing environments characterized by unexpected events and need to rapidly take action accordingly. To remedy this gap, we propose a new simulated embodied benchmark, called HAZARD, specifically designed to assess the decision-making abilities of embodied agents in dynamic situations. HAZARD consists of three unexpected disaster scenarios, including fire , flood , and wind , and specifically supports the utilization of large language models (LLMs) to assist common sense reasoning and decision-making. This benchmark enables us to evaluate autonomous agents\u2019 decision-making capabilities across various pipelines, including reinforcement learning (RL), rule-based, and search-based methods in dynamically changing environments. As a first step toward addressing this challenge using large language models, we further develop an LLM-based agent and perform an in-depth analysis of its promise and challenge of solving these challenging tasks.

        "abstract": "Retrosynthesis is the task of proposing a series of chemical reactions to create a desired molecule from simpler, buyable molecules. While previous works have proposed algorithms to find optimal solutions for a range of metrics (e.g. shortest, lowest-cost), these works generally overlook the fact that we have imperfect knowledge of the space of possible reactions, meaning plans created by the algorithm may not work in a laboratory. In this paper we propose a novel formulation of retrosynthesis in terms of stochastic processes to account for this uncertainty. We then propose a novel greedy algorithm called retro-fallback which maximizes the probability that at least one synthesis plan can be executed in the lab. Using in-silico benchmarks we demonstrate that retro-fallback generally produces better sets of synthesis plans than the popular MCTS and retro* algorithms.",

Here, we present a novel approach that utilizes microRNA (miRNA)-based gene editing to target disease-causing mutations in ND-related genes. Our approach, dubbed \"miRNA-Ed,\" employs a CRISPR-Cas9 mediated editing system to introduce a specific, disease-relevant miRNA sequence to the genome of cells. We demonstrated the efficacy of this approach in treating a range of ND-related genes, including those associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. Our results show that the introduction of the disease-relevant miRNA sequence leads to a significant reduction in disease-causing protein expression and a subsequent improvement in cellular function.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nNeurodegenerative diseases (ND) are a group of disorders characterized by progressive neuronal damage and loss, resulting in cognitive decline and motor dysfunction. Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease are among the most common NDs, with no known cure. Recent advances in gene editing have opened up new avenues for treating NDs. Here, we propose a novel therapeutic approach that utilizes microRNA (miRNA)-based gene editing to target disease-causing mutations in ND-related genes.\n\n**Materials and Methods:**\n\nWe used a CRISPR-Cas9 mediated editing system to introduce a specific, disease-relevant miRNA sequence to the genome of cells. The CRISPR-Cas9 system was used to edit the genome of cells in vitro, and the edited cells were then transplanted into animal models of ND. We used a range of ND-related genes, including those associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease.\n\n**Results:**\n\nWe demonstrated the efficacy of our approach in treating a range of ND-related genes, including those associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. Our results show that the introduction of the disease-relevant miRNA sequence leads to a significant reduction in disease-causing protein expression and a subsequent improvement in cellular function.\n\n**Discussion:**\n\nThe results of this study provide strong evidence for the potential of the \"miRNA-Ed\" approach in treating NDs. The use of CRISPR-Cas9 mediated gene editing to introduce a specific, disease-relevant miRNA sequence to the genome of cells represents a novel and promising therapeutic strategy for NDs. The significant reduction in disease-causing protein expression and subsequent improvement in cellular function observed in this study suggest that the \"miRNA-Ed\" approach has the potential to be a effective treatment for NDs.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\nOne of the main limitations of this study is the use of animal models of ND. While animal models can provide valuable insights into the biology of NDs, they may not accurately reflect the complex biology of NDs in humans. Additionally, the long-term efficacy and safety of the \"miRNA-Ed\" approach in humans remain unknown.\n\n**Future Directions:**\n\nFuture studies should aim to translate the findings of this study to the clinic, including the development of a therapeutic product using the \"miRNA-Ed\" approach. Additionally, further studies should investigate the long-term efficacy and safety of the \"miRNA-Ed\" approach in animal models and in vitro studies.\n\n**References:**\n\n[1] Smith, J. (2020).

The authors present a compelling argument for the potential of the \"miRNA-Ed\" approach in treating NDs, and the results of the studies are well-presented.\n\nHowever, the manuscript lacks a clear discussion of the potential risks and side effects of the \"miRNA-Ed\" approach.

        "abstract": "Variational Autoencoders (VAEs) have gained significant popularity among researchers as a powerful tool for understanding unknown distributions based on limited samples. This popularity stems partly from their impressive performance and partly from their ability to provide meaningful feature representations in the latent space. Wasserstein Autoencoders (WAEs), a variant of VAEs, aim to not only improve model efficiency but also interpretability. However, there has been limited focus on analyzing their statistical guarantees. The matter is further complicated by the fact that the data distributions to which WAEs are applied such as natural images are often presumed to possess an underlying low-dimensional structure within a high-dimensional feature space, which current theory does not adequately account for, rendering known bounds inefficient. To bridge the gap between the theory and practice of WAEs, in this paper, we show that WAEs can learn the data distributions when the network architectures are properly chosen. We show that the convergence rates of the expected excess risk in the number of samples for WAEs are independent of the high feature dimension, instead relying only on the intrinsic dimension of the data distribution.",

        "abstract": "Reward modeling (a.k.a., preference modeling) is instrumental for aligning large language models with human preferences, particularly within the context of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While conventional reward models (RMs) have exhibited remarkable scalability, they oft struggle with fundamental functionality such as arithmetic computation, code execution, and factual lookup. In this paper, we propose a tool-augmented preference modeling approach, named Themis, to address these limitations by empowering RMs with access to external environments, including calculators and search engines. This approach not only fosters synergy between tool utilization and reward grading but also enhances interpretive capacity and scoring reliability. Our study delves into the integration of external tools into RMs, enabling them to interact with diverse external sources and construct task-specific tool engagement and reasoning traces in an autoregressive manner. We validate our approach across a wide range of domains, incorporating seven distinct external tools. Our experimental results demonstrate a noteworthy overall improvement of 17.7% across eight tasks in preference ranking. Furthermore, our approach outperforms Gopher 280B by 7.3% on TruthfulQA task in zero-shot evaluation. In human evaluations, RLHF trained with Themis attains an average win rate of 32% when compared to baselines across four distinct tasks. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive collection of tool-related RM datasets, incorporating data from seven distinct tool APIs, totaling 15,000 instances. We have made the code, data, and model checkpoints publicly available to facilitate and inspire further research advancements1.",

ADoPD distinguishes itself by utilizing a novel data-driven document taxonomy discovery method for data collection. Our approach takes advantage of both large-scale pretrained models and human-in-the-loop process, ensuring diversity and balance in our data collection. Leveraging our data-driven document taxonomy, we collected and densely annotated labels for document images, covering four document image understanding tasks: Doc2Mask, Doc2Box, Doc2Tag, and Doc2Seq. Specifically, for each image, the annotations include human-labeled entity masks, text bounding boxes, as well as automatically generated tags and captions. We provide detailed experimental analyses to validate our data-driven document taxonomy method and experimentally analyze the four tasks based on different models. We believe that ADoPD has the potential to become a cornerstone dataset to support future research on document image understanding.",

        "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are adopted as a fundamental component of language technologies, it is crucial to accurately characterize their performance. Because choices in prompt design can strongly influence model behavior, this design process is critical in effectively using any modern pre-trained generative language model. In this work, we focus on LLM sensitivity to a quintessential class of meaning-preserving design choices: prompt formatting. We find that several widely used open-source LLMs are extremely sensitive to subtle changes in prompt formatting in few-shot settings, with performance differences of up to 76 accuracy points when evaluated using LLaMA-2-13B. Sensitivity remains even when increasing model size, the number of few-shot examples, or performing instruction tuning. Our analysis suggests that work evaluating LLMs with prompting-based methods would benefit from reporting a range of performance across plausible prompt formats, instead of the currently-standard practice of reporting performance on a single format. We also show that format performance only weakly correlates between models, which puts into question the methodological validity of comparing models with an arbitrarily chosen, fixed prompt format. To facilitate systematic analysis we propose FORMATSPREAD, an algorithm that rapidly evaluates a sampled set of plausible prompt formats for a given task, and reports the interval of expected performance without accessing model weights1. Furthermore, we present a suite of analyses that characterize the nature of this sensitivity, including exploring the influence of particular atomic perturbations and the internal representation of particular formats.",

        "title": "IDEAL: INFLUENCE-DRIVEN SELECTIVE ANNOTA- TIONS EMPOWER IN-CONTEXT LEARNERS IN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS",
        "abstract": "In-context learning is a promising paradigm that utilizes in-context examples as prompts for the predictions of large language models. These prompts are crucial for achieving strong performance. However, since the prompts need to be sampled from a large volume of annotated examples, finding the right prompt may result in high annotation costs. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an influence-driven selective annotation method that aims to minimize annotation costs while improving the quality of in-context examples. The essence of our method is to select a pivotal subset from a large-scale unlabeled data pool to annotate for the subsequent sampling of prompts. Specifically, a directed graph is first constructed to represent unlabeled data. Afterward, the influence of candidate unlabeled subsets is quantified with a diffusion process. A simple yet effective greedy algorithm for unlabeled data selection is lastly introduced. It iteratively selects the data if it provides a maximum marginal gain with respect to quantified influence. Compared with previous efforts on selective annotations, our influencedriven method works in an end-to-end manner, avoids an intractable explicit balance between data diversity and representativeness, and enjoys theoretical support. Experiments confirm the superiority of the proposed method on various benchmarks, achieving better performance under lower time consumption during subset selection.

The authors' use of topological phase transitions as a basis for quantum error correction offers a unique perspective, warranting a closer examination of their method's efficacy. Here's my detailed, critical, but constructive evaluation of the paper.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n- The authors provide a clear, concise, and well-structured explanation of their approach, making it accessible to both experts in the field and newcomers.\n- They effectively leverage the topological properties of phase transitions to create a robust quantum error correction framework.\n- The inclusion of numerical simulations supports the theoretical claims, adding credibility to the approach.\n- The paper includes a thorough discussion of the potential applications of this method in various quantum computing platforms, showcasing the authors' understanding of the broader implications of their work.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n- The paper relies heavily on simplifications, assuming a basic understanding of topological phase transitions. While the authors provide a good overview, readers unfamiliar with this topic might find the explanation insufficient.\n- The authors' approach may not be universally applicable, as the effectiveness of topological phase transitions in quantum error correction depends heavily on specific system characteristics.\n- The discussion of potential applications could be more comprehensive, covering a wider range of quantum computing platforms, such as superconducting circuits or ion traps.\n- The numerical simulations, while informative, may not be sufficient to validate the approach's efficacy in all possible quantum computing environments.\n- The paper lacks a detailed discussion of the computational complexity of implementing this method in practice, an essential consideration in the development of quantum algorithms.\n- The authors could have benefited from a more thorough analysis of the interplay between the topological phase transitions and the quantum noise, as this might affect the overall performance of the proposed quantum error correction method.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n- To improve the paper's clarity, the authors could provide a more detailed explanation of the mathematical framework underlying their approach, particularly in the sections related to topological phase transitions.\n- The authors should consider exploring the applicability of their method in more complex quantum computing platforms, such as those incorporating multiple-qubit interactions or noise sources.\n- To enhance the credibility of their approach, the authors should conduct more comprehensive numerical simulations, incorporating a wider range of quantum computing environments.\n- A detailed discussion of the computational complexity of implementing this method in practice could provide valuable insights into the feasibility of the proposed quantum algorithm.\n- The authors could explore the interplay between the topological phase transitions and the quantum noise in more depth, discussing potential mitigation strategies or ways to improve the overall performance of the proposed quantum error correction method.\n- The discussion of potential applications could be expanded to include a more comprehensive analysis of the advantages and limitations of this method in various quantum computing platforms.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nWhile the paper \"A Novel Approach to Quantum Error Correction in Topological Phase Transitions\" presents an interesting exploration of a novel quantum error correction approach, it falls short in providing a comprehensive analysis of the method's efficacy in various quantum computing environments. The authors' use of topological phase transitions as a basis for quantum error correction offers a unique perspective, but it requires a more thorough examination of the method's limitations, potential applications, and computational complexity.

        "title": "WIN-WIN: TRAINING HIGH-RESOLUTION VISION TRANSFORMERS",
        "abstract": "Transformers have become the standard in state-of-the-art vision architectures, achieving impressive performance on both image-level and dense pixelwise tasks. However, training vision transformers for high-resolution pixelwise tasks has a prohibitive cost. Typical solutions boil down to hierarchical architectures, fast and approximate attention, or training on low-resolution crops. This latter solution does not constrain architectural choices, but it leads to a clear performance drop when testing at resolutions significantly higher than that used for training, thus requiring ad-hoc and slow post-processing schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for efficient training and inference of high-resolution vision transformers: the key principle is to mask out most of the high-resolution inputs during training, keeping only N random windows. This allows the model to learn local interactions between tokens inside each window, and global interactions between tokens from different windows. As a result, the model can directly process the high-resolution input at test time without any special trick. We show that this strategy is effective when using relative positional embedding such as rotary embeddings. It is 4 times faster to train than a full-resolution network, and it is straightforward to use at test time compared to existing approaches. We apply this strategy to two dense prediction tasks with high resolution data. First, we show on the task of semantic segmentation that a simple setting with 2 windows performs best, hence the name of our method: Win-Win.

        "abstract": "Existing losses used in deep metric learning (DML) for image retrieval often lead to highly non-uniform intra-class and inter-class representation structures across test classes and data distributions. When combined with the common practice of using a fixed threshold to declare a match, this gives rise to significant performance variations in terms of false accept rate (FAR) and false reject rate (FRR) across test classes and data distributions. We define this issue in DML as threshold inconsistency. In real-world applications, such inconsistency often complicates the threshold selection process when deploying commercial image retrieval systems. To measure this inconsistency, we propose a novel variance-based metric called Operating-Point-Inconsistency-Score (OPIS) that quantifies the variance in the operating characteristics across classes. Using the OPIS metric, we find that achieving high accuracy levels in a DML model does not automatically guarantee threshold consistency. In fact, our investigation reveals a Pareto frontier in the high-accuracy regime, where existing methods to improve accuracy often lead to degradation in threshold consistency. To address this trade-off, we introduce the Threshold-Consistent Margin (TCM) loss, a simple yet effective regularization technique that promotes uniformity in representation structures across classes by selectively penalizing hard sample pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate TCM\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing threshold consistency while preserving accuracy, simplifying the threshold selection process in practical DML settings.",

        "abstract": "COMpression with Bayesian Implicit NEural Representations (COMBINER) is a recent data compression method that addresses a key inefficiency of previous Implicit Neural Representation (INR)-based approaches: it avoids quantization and enables direct optimization of the rate-distortion performance. However, COMBINER still has significant limitations: 1) it uses factorized priors and posterior approximations that lack flexibility; 2) it cannot effectively adapt to local deviations from global patterns in the data; and 3) its performance can be susceptible to modeling choices and the variational parameters\u2019 initializations. Our proposed method, Robust and Enhanced COMBINER (RECOMBINER), addresses these issues by 1) enriching the variational approximation while retaining a low computational cost via a linear reparameterization of the INR weights, 2) augmenting our INRs with learnable positional encodings that enable them to adapt to local details and 3) splitting high-resolution data into patches to increase robustness and utilizing expressive hierarchical priors to capture dependency across patches. We conduct extensive experiments across several data modalities, showcasing that RECOMBINER achieves competitive results with the best INR-based methods and even outperforms autoencoder-based codecs on lowresolution images at low bitrates. Our PyTorch implementation is available at https://github.com/cambridge-mlg/RECOMBINER/.",

The authors conducted an experiment in which wheat plants were grown under four different temperature regimes: optimal, warm, cool, and cold. The results showed that optimal temperature had the highest yield and quality of wheat, while cold temperature had the lowest. The authors conclude that optimal temperature is crucial for maximizing wheat yield and quality.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe study provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of different temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality. The authors' use of a controlled experiment and their attention to detail in measuring and analyzing the data are commendable.\n\n**Methodological Strengths:**\n\nThe study's methodology is sound, and the authors have clearly outlined their experimental procedures. The use of four different temperature regimes allows the authors to explore the effects of temperature on wheat yield and quality in a comprehensive manner. The data analysis is also well-structured and easy to follow.\n\n**Methodological Weaknesses:**\n\nOne potential limitation of the study is the lack of replication. The authors only conducted a single experiment, which may not be representative of the results in other environments. It would be beneficial to replicate the experiment in multiple locations and under different weather conditions to increase the generalizability of the findings.\n\n**Statistical Analysis:**\n\nThe authors have conducted a one-way ANOVA analysis to compare the effects of temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality. However, it would be beneficial to include a post-hoc analysis to determine which specific temperature regimes have the most significant effects on wheat yield and quality. This would provide a more detailed understanding of the relationships between temperature and wheat yield and quality.\n\n**Results and Discussion:**\n\nThe results of the study are well-presented and clearly summarized in the abstract and discussion sections. However, the authors' interpretation of the results may be too simplistic. The optimal temperature regime had the highest yield and quality, but this may not be the case in all environments. The authors should have considered the potential interactions between temperature and other environmental factors, such as moisture and light, which may also affect wheat yield and quality.\n\n**Contribution to the Field:**\n\nThe study contributes to our understanding of the effects of temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality, but it does not provide a comprehensive understanding of the underlying mechanisms. The authors should have explored the potential interactions between temperature and other environmental factors, as well as the impact of temperature on wheat plant growth and development.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\nBased on the review, I recommend that the authors:\n\n* Replicate the experiment in multiple locations and under different weather conditions to increase the generalizability of the findings.\n* Conduct a post-hoc analysis to determine which specific temperature regimes have the most significant effects on wheat yield and quality.\n* Explore the potential interactions between temperature and other environmental factors, as well as the impact of temperature on wheat plant growth and development.\n* Consider the potential limitations of the study and provide a more detailed discussion of the results and their interpretation.\n\n**Rating:**\n\nI would rate this study as 7 out of 10. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of the effects of different temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality, but it has several limitations that need to be addressed.",

We propose a general methodology to combine the power of LLMs and automated reasoners for automated program verification. We formally describe this methodology as a set of derivation rules and prove its soundness. We instantiate the calculus as a sound automated verification procedure, which led to practical improvements on a set of synthetic and competition benchmarks.",

We introduce a new reinforcement learning framework that can learn to allocate resources to different tasks while minimizing the overall resource utilization. Our approach is based on a deep reinforcement learning model that learns to predict the optimal resource allocation by predicting the task completion probabilities. We evaluate our approach using a variety of benchmarks, including the Stanford Multi-Task Learning benchmark, which consists of 10 tasks with varying levels of complexity. Our results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average accuracy of 92.5%, with a significant reduction in resource utilization.\n\n**Paper:**\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nMulti-task learning (MLT) has gained significant attention in recent years due to its ability to improve the performance of machine learning models on multiple tasks simultaneously. In this paper, we aim to optimize resource allocation for MLT by introducing a novel reinforcement learning approach. Our approach is based on a deep reinforcement learning model that can learn to allocate resources to different tasks while minimizing the overall resource utilization.\n\n**Background:**\n\nReinforcement learning (RL) has been widely used to optimize resource allocation in various fields, including computer networks, robotics, and finance. In the context of MLT, RL has been used to optimize resource allocation for tasks such as image classification, natural language processing, and object detection. However, most RL approaches for MLT have a limited capacity to handle multiple tasks simultaneously, resulting in sub-optimal resource allocation.\n\n**Methodology:**\n\nOur approach is based on a deep reinforcement learning model that learns to predict the optimal resource allocation by predicting the task completion probabilities. The model consists of two main components: a policy network that learns to predict the task completion probabilities, and a value function that learns to predict the expected utility of each task. The policy network is trained using a reinforcement learning algorithm, such as Q-learning or SARSA, while the value function is trained using a deep neural network.\n\n**Implementation:**\n\nWe implement our approach using a Python library, such as PyTorch or Keras, to train the policy network and value function. The policy network is trained using a reinforcement learning algorithm, while the value function is trained using a deep neural network. We evaluate our approach using a variety of benchmarks, including the Stanford Multi-Task Learning benchmark, which consists of 10 tasks with varying levels of complexity.\n\n**Evaluation:**\n\nWe evaluate our approach using a variety of metrics, including accuracy, resource utilization, and task completion time. We compare our approach to state-of-the-art methods, including traditional machine learning approaches, RL methods, and hybrid approaches. Our results show that our approach outperforms state-of-the-art methods, achieving an average accuracy of 92.5%, with a significant reduction in resource utilization.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, our approach provides a novel reinforcement learning framework for optimizing resource allocation for MLT. Our approach is based on a deep reinforcement learning model that can learn to allocate resources to different tasks while minimizing the overall resource utilization. We evaluate our approach using a variety of benchmarks, including the Stanford Multi-Task Learning benchmark, which consists of 10 tasks with varying levels of complexity.

We consider a training dataset with well-separated input vectors: Any pair of input data with the same label are positively correlated, and any pair with different labels are negatively correlated. Our analysis shows that, during the early phase of training, neurons in the first layer try to align with either the positive data or the negative data, depending on its corresponding weight on the second layer. A careful analysis of the neurons\u2019 directional dynamics allows us to provide an O( logn \u221a\u03bc ) upper bound on the time it takes for all neurons to achieve good alignment with the input data, where n is the number of data points and \u03bc measures how well the data are separated. After the early alignment phase, the loss converges to zero at a O( 1t ) rate, and the weight matrix on the first layer is approximately low-rank. Numerical experiments on the MNIST dataset illustrate our theoretical findings.",

        "title": "FLOW MATCHING ON GENERAL GEOMETRIES",
        "abstract": "We propose Riemannian Flow Matching (RFM), a simple yet powerful framework for training continuous normalizing flows on manifolds. Existing methods for generative modeling on manifolds either require expensive simulation, are inherently unable to scale to high dimensions, or use approximations for limiting quantities that result in biased training objectives. Riemannian Flow Matching bypasses these limitations and offers several advantages over previous approaches: it is simulation-free on simple geometries, does not require divergence computation, and computes its target vector field in closed-form. The key ingredient behind RFM is the construction of a relatively simple premetric for defining target vector fields, which encompasses the existing Euclidean case. To extend to general geometries, we rely on the use of spectral decompositions to efficiently compute premetrics on the fly. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on many real-world nonEuclidean datasets, and we demonstrate tractable training on general geometries, including triangular meshes with highly non-trivial curvature and boundaries.",

        "abstract": "Recently, Transformer-based and MLP-based models have emerged rapidly and won dominance in time series analysis. In contrast, convolution is losing steam in time series tasks nowadays for inferior performance. This paper studies the open question of how to better use convolution in time series analysis and makes efforts to bring convolution back to the arena of time series analysis. To this end, we modernize the traditional TCN and conduct time series related modifications to make it more suitable for time series tasks. As the outcome, we propose ModernTCN and successfully solve this open question through a seldom-explored way in time series community. As a pure convolution structure, ModernTCN still achieves the consistent state-of-the-art performance on five mainstream time series analysis tasks while maintaining the efficiency advantage of convolution-based models, therefore providing a better balance of efficiency and performance than state-of-the-art Transformer-based and MLP-based models. Our study further reveals that, compared with previous convolution-based models, our ModernTCN has much larger effective receptive fields (ERFs), therefore can better unleash the potential of convolution in time series analysis.

        "abstract": "As neural networks grow in scale, their training becomes both computationally demanding and rich in dynamics. Amidst the flourishing interest in these training dynamics, we present a novel observation: Parameters during training exhibit intrinsic correlations over time. Capitalizing on this, we introduce correlation mode decomposition (CMD). This algorithm clusters the parameter space into groups, termed modes, that display synchronized behavior across epochs. This enables CMD to efficiently represent the training dynamics of complex networks, like ResNets and Transformers, using only a few modes. Moreover, test set generalization is enhanced. We introduce an efficient CMD variant, designed to run concurrently with training. Our experiments indicate that CMD surpasses the state-of-the-art method for compactly modeled dynamics on image classification. Our modeling can improve training efficiency and lower communication overhead, as shown by our preliminary experiments in the context of federated learning.",

A total of 120 tomato plants were grown in controlled environments with varying pH levels (4, 5, 5.5, 7, 7.5, and 8). The plants were watered with a balanced fertilizer solution, and their height, leaf area, and fruit yield were measured and recorded at regular intervals over a period of 60 days. The results showed that optimal pH levels for tomato plant growth were between 5.5 and 7, with the highest yield and leaf area observed at pH 7.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nTomato plants are an important crop for agriculture, providing essential nutrients and vitamins for human consumption. However, the optimal pH levels for tomato plant growth are often overlooked, which can lead to reduced crop yield and plant stress.\n\n**Methods:**\n\nOne hundred and twenty tomato plants were grown in controlled environments with varying pH levels, as mentioned earlier. The plants were watered with a balanced fertilizer solution, and their height, leaf area, and fruit yield were measured and recorded at regular intervals over a period of 60 days.\n\n**Results:**\n\nThe results of this study are presented in Table 1.\n\n| pH Level | Height (cm) | Leaf Area (cm\u00b2) | Fruit Yield (g/plant) |\n| --- | --- | --- | --- |\n| 4 | 15 | 10 | 20 |\n| 5 | 20 | 25 | 30 |\n| 5.5 | 25 | 30 | 35 |\n| 7 | 30 | 40 | 45 |\n| 7.5 | 28 | 35 | 40 |\n| 8 | 22 | 20 | 25 |\n\nThe highest yield and leaf area were observed at pH 7, while the lowest yield and leaf area were observed at pH 4 and 8, respectively.\n\n**Discussion:**\n\nThe results of this study are consistent with the optimal pH levels for tomato plant growth, which is between 5.5 and 7, as mentioned earlier. The optimal pH range allows for optimal nutrient uptake and utilization by the plant, resulting in higher yield and leaf area.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrated that optimal pH levels for tomato plant growth are between 5.5 and 7, with the highest yield and leaf area observed at pH 7.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\nOverall, this study provides a comprehensive overview of the effects of different pH levels on the growth and yield of tomato plants.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. The study was well-conducted, and the results were clearly presented in a table format.\n2. The authors properly controlled for environmental factors and used a balanced fertilizer solution.\n3. The sample size of 120 plants is sufficient for a reliable conclusion.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. The study only examined the effects of pH levels on tomato plant growth and did not investigate other factors that may affect plant health, such as temperature, light, and water availability.\n2. The authors did not discuss the potential limitations of the study, such as the potential for pH fluctuations within the controlled environment.\n3. The study only examined the effects of pH levels on tomato plant yield and did not investigate other parameters, such as plant stress, disease susceptibility, or nutrient uptake.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1.

The authors should discuss the potential limitations of the study and provide recommendations for future research.\n3. The authors should investigate other parameters, such as plant stress, disease susceptibility, or nutrient uptake, in addition to yield and leaf area.\n\n**Rating:**\n\nI give this study a rating of 7/10, as it provides a comprehensive overview of the effects of different pH levels on tomato plant growth and yield, but has some limitations in its scope and methodology.\n\n**Recommendation for publication:**\n\nI recommend that the authors revise the manuscript and address the weaknesses and limitations of the study before submitting it for publication.\n\n**Additional comments:**\n\nThe authors should consider using a more robust statistical analysis, such as ANOVA, to analyze the results and provide a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of pH levels on tomato plant growth and yield.\n\nIn conclusion, this study provides a solid foundation for further research on the effects of pH levels on tomato plant growth and yield, but requires additional investigation and analysis to provide a more complete understanding of the topic.\n\n**Recommendation for further research:**\n\nThe authors should investigate the effects of other factors, such as temperature, light, and water availability, on tomato plant growth and yield, and explore the potential applications of this research in agricultural and horticultural practices.\n\n**Recommendation for funding:**\n\nThe

However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments. We present a novel approach, Blockwise RingAttention, which leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward to distribute long sequences across multiple devices while fully overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the computation of blockwise attention. Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size and improving performance.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion models achieved great success in image synthesis, but still face challenges in high-resolution generation. Through the lens of discrete cosine transformation, we find the main reason is that the same noise level on a higher resolution results in a higher Signal-to-Noise Ratio in the frequency domain. In this work, we present Relay Diffusion Model (RDM), which transfers a low-resolution image or noise into an equivalent high-resolution one for diffusion model via blurring diffusion and block noise. Therefore, the diffusion process can continue seamlessly in any new resolution or model without restarting from pure noise or lowresolution conditioning.

Department of Neurology, Harvard Medical School, Boston, MA\n2. Department of Neurosciences, Massachusetts General Hospital, Boston, MA\n3. Laboratory of Neuroinflammation, National Institute on Aging, Bethesda, MD\n\n**Abstract:**\n\nIn this study, we describe the development of a novel therapeutic approach for treating neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. Our approach involves the use of a small molecule inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which plays a key role in the activation of inflammatory responses in the brain. We demonstrate that this inhibitor, combined with a chaperone molecule, reduces neuroinflammation and improves symptoms in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. These results suggest that this approach may be a promising new therapy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nAlzheimer's disease is a complex and multifactorial disorder characterized by the progressive loss of memory and cognitive function. Neuroinflammation is a key component of the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, and it is thought to play a critical role in the development of the disease. The NLRP3 inflammasome is a multiprotein complex that plays a key role in the activation of inflammatory responses in the brain. Inhibiting the NLRP3 inflammasome has been shown to be a promising approach for treating neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease.\n\n**Methods:**\n\nWe used a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease to test the efficacy of our novel therapeutic approach. The mouse model was generated by crossing mice with a mutation in the amyloid precursor protein (APP) gene, which is a key component of the Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology. The mice were treated with a small molecule inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which was combined with a chaperone molecule. The mice were then evaluated for the presence of neuroinflammation and the severity of symptoms.\n\n**Results:**\n\nOur results show that the combination of the small molecule inhibitor and the chaperone molecule significantly reduces neuroinflammation and improves symptoms in the mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. The mice that were treated with the combination of the small molecule inhibitor and the chaperone molecule showed a significant reduction in the expression of inflammatory genes, such as TNF-alpha and IL-1beta. Additionally, the mice showed a significant improvement in their performance on behavioral tasks, such as the Morris water maze.\n\n**Discussion:**\n\nOur results suggest that the novel therapeutic approach we developed may be a promising new therapy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. The use of a small molecule inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome, combined with a chaperone molecule, may provide a novel and effective way to treat neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. The results of this study also suggest that the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a key role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, and that inhibiting this inflammasome may be a critical component of a comprehensive therapy for the disease.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn this study, we describe the development of a novel therapeutic approach for treating neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. Our approach involves the use of a small molecule inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome, which plays a key role in the activation of inflammatory responses in the brain. We demonstrate that this inhibitor, combined with a chaperone molecule, reduces neuroinflammation and improves symptoms in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. These results suggest that this approach may be a promising new therapy for the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\nThis study has several limitations. Firstly, the study was conducted in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, and it is unclear whether the results will be applicable to humans. Secondly, the study only evaluated the effects of the combination of the small molecule inhibitor and the chaperone molecule on neuroinflammation and symptoms in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, and it did not evaluate the long-term effects of the therapy. Finally, the study did not evaluate the safety and efficacy of the therapy in a human clinical trial.\n\n**Future Directions:**\n\nFuture directions for this study would involve conducting a human clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the therapy. Additionally, future directions would involve evaluating the long-term effects of the therapy and determining whether the results of this study are applicable to humans. Further investigation into the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease would also be necessary to fully understand the mechanism of action of this therapy.\n\n**References:**\n\n1. [Insert references cited in the paper]\n\n**Critical Review:**\n\nOverall, this paper presents a promising new approach for treating neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. The use of a small molecule inhibitor of the NLRP3 inflammasome, combined with a chaperone molecule, may provide a novel and effective way to treat neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. The results of this study also suggest that the NLRP3 inflammasome plays a key role in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, and that inhibiting this inflammasome may be a critical component of a comprehensive therapy for the disease.\n\nHowever, there are several limitations to this study that must be considered. Firstly, the study was conducted in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, and it is unclear whether the results will be applicable to humans. Secondly, the study only evaluated the effects of the combination of the small molecule inhibitor and the chaperone molecule on neuroinflammation and symptoms in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, and it did not evaluate the long-term effects of the therapy. Finally, the study did not evaluate the safety and efficacy of the therapy in a human clinical trial.\n\nTo address these limitations, future directions for this study would involve conducting a human clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the therapy. Additionally, future directions would involve evaluating the long-term effects of the therapy and determining whether the results of this study are applicable to humans. Further investigation into the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease would also be necessary to fully understand the mechanism of action of this therapy.\n\nIn terms of the methodology, the study appears to be well-designed and well-conducted. The use of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease is a common approach for studying neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease, and the results of this study are consistent with previous findings. However, the study would benefit from the inclusion of more controls, such as a group of mice that were not treated with the combination of the small molecule inhibitor and the chaperone molecule.\n\nIn terms of the interpretation of the results, the study appears to be well-conducting. The results of this study suggest that the combination of the small molecule inhibitor and the chaperone molecule significantly reduces neuroinflammation and improves symptoms in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. However, the study would benefit from a more detailed discussion of the potential limitations and biases of the study.\n\nOverall, this paper presents a promising new approach for treating neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. However, there are several limitations to this study that must be considered, and further investigation is necessary to fully understand the mechanism of action of this therapy and to determine whether the results of this study are applicable to humans.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nBased on the results of this study, I recommend that the authors proceed with conducting a human clinical trial to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the therapy. I also recommend that the authors conduct further investigation into the role of the NLRP3 inflammasome in the pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease to fully understand the mechanism of action of this therapy. Finally, I recommend that the authors carefully consider the limitations and biases of the study and provide a more detailed discussion of the potential limitations and biases of the study.\n\n**Final Thoughts:**\n\nIn summary, this paper presents a promising new approach for treating neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease.

        "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in learning node embeddings for link prediction (LP). While numerous studies aim to improve the overall LP performance of GNNs, none have explored its varying performance across different nodes and its underlying reasons. To this end, we aim to demystify which nodes will perform better from the perspective of their local topology. Despite the widespread belief that low-degree nodes exhibit poorer LP performance, our empirical findings provide nuances to this viewpoint and prompt us to propose a better metric, Topological Concentration (TC), based on the intersection of the local subgraph of each node with the ones of its neighbors. We empirically demonstrate that TC has a higher correlation with LP performance than other node-level topological metrics like degree and subgraph density, offering a better way to identify low-performing nodes than using degree. With TC, we discover a novel topological distribution shift issue in which newly joined neighbors of a node tend to become less interactive with that node\u2019s existing neighbors, compromising the generalizability of node embeddings for LP at testing time. To make the computation of TC scalable, We further propose Approximated Topological Concentration (ATC) and theoretically/empirically justify its efficacy in approximating TC and reducing the computation complexity. Given the positive correlation between node TC and its LP performance, we explore the potential of boosting LP performance via enhancing TC by re-weighting edges in the message-passing and discuss its effectiveness with limitations.

We propose a game-theoretic diffusion model to decompose the input into visual parts using the dictionaries learned by the Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm, implemented as the online prototype clustering, based on the decomposition results. Additionally, two metrics, clustering information gain, and heuristic shape score are proposed to evaluate the model. Experiments are conducted on three abstract compositional visual object datasets, which require the model to utilize the compositionality of data instead of simply exploiting visual features. Then, three tasks on symbol grounding to predefined classes of parts and relations, as well as transfer learning to unseen classes, followed by a human evaluation, were carried out on these datasets. The results show that the proposed method discovers compositional patterns, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised part segmentation methods that rely on visual features from pre-trained backbones. Furthermore, the proposed metrics are consistent with human evaluations.",

        "title": "ZERO-MEAN REGULARIZED SPECTRAL CONTRASTIVE LEARNING: IMPLICITLY MITIGATING WRONG CON-",
        "abstract": "Contrastive learning has emerged as a popular paradigm of self-supervised learning that learns representations by encouraging representations of positive pairs to be similar while representations of negative pairs to be far apart. The spectral contrastive loss, in synergy with the notion of positive-pair graphs, offers valuable theoretical insights into the empirical successes of contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose incorporating an additive factor into the term of spectral contrastive loss involving negative pairs. This simple modification can be equivalently viewed as introducing a regularization term that enforces the mean of representations to be zero, which thus is referred to as zero-mean regularization. It intuitively relaxes the orthogonality of representations between negative pairs and implicitly alleviates the adverse effect of wrong connections in the positive-pair graph, leading to better performance and robustness. To clarify this, we thoroughly investigate the role of zero-mean regularized spectral contrastive loss in both unsupervised and supervised scenarios with respect to theoretical analysis and quantitative evaluation. These results highlight the potential of zero-mean regularized spectral contrastive learning to be a promising approach in various tasks.",

        "abstract": "We resolve the open question regarding the sample complexity of policy learning for maximizing the long-run average reward associated with a uniformly ergodic Markov decision process (MDP), assuming a generative model. In this context, the existing literature provides a sample complexity upper bound of \u00d5(|S||A|tmix\u03b5)* and a lower bound of \u03a9(|S||A|tmix\u03b5). In these expressions, |S| and |A| denote the cardinalities of the state and action spaces respectively, tmix serves as a uniform upper limit for the total variation mixing times, and \u03b5 signifies the error tolerance. Therefore, a notable gap of tmix still remains to be bridged. Our primary contribution is the development of an estimator for the optimal policy of average reward MDPs with a sample complexity of \u00d5(|S||A|tmix\u03b5). This marks the first algorithm and analysis to reach the literature\u2019s lower bound. Our new algorithm draws inspiration from ideas in Li et al. (2020), Jin & Sidford (2021), and Wang et al.

        "abstract": "We study the notion of a generalization bound being uniformly tight, meaning that the difference between the bound and the population loss is small for all learning algorithms and all population distributions. Numerous generalization bounds have been proposed in the literature as potential explanations for the ability of neural networks to generalize in the overparameterized setting. However, in their paper \u201cFantastic Generalization Measures and Where to Find Them,\u201d Jiang et al. (2020) examine more than a dozen generalization bounds, and show empirically that none of them are uniformly tight. This raises the question of whether uniformly-tight generalization bounds are at all possible in the overparameterized setting. We consider two types of generalization bounds: (1) bounds that may depend on the training set and the learned hypothesis (e.g., margin bounds). We prove mathematically that no such bound can be uniformly tight in the overparameterized setting; (2) bounds that may in addition also depend on the learning algorithm (e.g., stability bounds). For these bounds, we show a trade-off between the algorithm\u2019s performance and the bound\u2019s tightness. Namely, if the algorithm achieves good accuracy on certain distributions, then no generalization bound can be uniformly tight for it in the overparameterized setting. We explain how these formal results can, in our view, inform research on generalization bounds for neural networks, while stressing that other interpretations of these results are also possible.",

The paper's comprehensive approach to addressing the impacts of climate change on amphibians is noteworthy. By integrating remote sensing data, literature reviews, and statistical models, the authors are able to synthesize a wide range of data sources and offer a holistic view of the issue.\n2. The use of specific climate variables, such as temperature and rainfall, is well justified, as these factors are known to have significant impacts on amphibian populations. \n3. The authors' conclusion that the distribution and abundance of amphibians are being altered by climate change is well-supported by the available data.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1.

While the authors discuss the relationships between climate variables and amphibian populations, they do not present any quantitative measures of the actual changes in population abundance or distribution.\n2. The authors' reliance on remote sensing data may be limited by the quality and resolution of the data. While remote sensing data can be useful for analyzing broad-scale patterns, it may not be suitable for detailed, site-specific analysis.\n3.

For example, the authors do not discuss the potential impacts of changes in temperature and rainfall on larval development, metamorphosis, or adult survival.\n\n**Suggestions for Future Work:**\n\n1. The authors should consider incorporating more empirical data on the actual impacts of climate change on amphibian populations. This could involve conducting site-specific studies, analyzing existing datasets, or using meta-analysis techniques to synthesize the available data.\n2. To improve the quality and resolution of the remote sensing data, the authors could consider using more advanced remote sensing techniques, such as LiDAR or hyperspectral imaging.\n3. A more detailed discussion of the potential mechanisms underlying the impacts of climate change on amphibian populations would enhance the paper's overall coherence and rigor.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, the paper by Dr. Maria Rodriguez, et al., presents a comprehensive investigation into the impacts of climate change on the distribution and abundance of amphibians in tropical regions. While the paper has several strengths, it is limited by the lack of empirical data on the actual impacts of climate change on amphibian populations. To further strengthen the paper, the authors should consider incorporating more empirical data, using more advanced remote sensing techniques, and discussing the potential mechanisms underlying the impacts of climate change on amphibian populations.\n\n**Rating:** (4/5 stars)\n\n**Recommendation:** This paper would be of interest to researchers in the fields of ecology, conservation biology, and climate science. While it has several limitations, it presents a comprehensive and well-structured investigation into the impacts of climate change on amphibian populations, and its results have the potential to inform conservation efforts and policy decisions.",

        "abstract": "Existing NAS methods suffer from either an excessive amount of time for repetitive sampling and training of many task-irrelevant architectures. To tackle such limitations of existing NAS methods, we propose a paradigm shift from NAS to a novel conditional Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) framework based on diffusion models, dubbed DiffusionNAG. Specifically, we consider the neural architectures as directed graphs and propose a graph diffusion model for generating them. Moreover, with the guidance of parameterized predictors, DiffusionNAG can flexibly generate task-optimal architectures with the desired properties for diverse tasks, by sampling from a region that is more likely to satisfy the properties. This conditional NAG scheme is significantly more efficient than previous NAS schemes which sample the architectures and filter them using the property predictors. We validate the effectiveness of DiffusionNAG through extensive experiments in two predictor-based NAS scenarios: Transferable NAS and Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based NAS. DiffusionNAG achieves superior performance with speedups of up to 20\u00d7 when compared to the baselines on Transferable NAS benchmarks. Furthermore, when integrated into a BO-based algorithm, DiffusionNAG outperforms existing BO-based NAS approaches, particularly in the large MobileNetV3 search space on the ImageNet 1K dataset.",

Smith, M. Johnson, S. Lee\n\nPeer Review:\n\nAbstract:\nThe paper presents a study examining the impact of various temperature regimes on plant growth in a controlled environment. The authors conducted experiments using four different temperature conditions: 15\u00b0C, 20\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C. Results show significant differences in plant growth parameters such as leaf area, stem length, and root development between temperature regimes. The authors suggest potential applications in agriculture, horticulture, and green technology.\n\nIntroduction:\nThe study begins by highlighting the importance of temperature in plant growth, citing various studies on temperature's role in plant development. The authors introduce their research question: \"How do different temperature regimes affect plant growth in a controlled environment?\" The literature review is concise, but it could benefit from more in-depth analysis of existing research.\n\nMethodology:\nThe experiment was conducted in a growth chamber with four temperature conditions. The authors used a randomized complete block design, with 10 replicates for each temperature condition. Plant growth parameters were measured at 30, 60, 120, and 180 days after planting. The results show significant differences in plant growth parameters between temperature regimes.\n\nResults:\nThe results are presented in a clear and concise manner, with detailed descriptions of each temperature regime. The authors highlight significant differences in leaf area, stem length, and root development between temperature regimes. However, some graphs appear to be missing or have incorrect labels, which may make it difficult for readers to interpret.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe authors discuss potential applications of their findings in agriculture, horticulture, and green technology. However, their discussion is limited, and they fail to address potential limitations of their study. The authors suggest potential avenues for future research, but these are not fully developed.\n\nConclusion:\nThe study concludes by highlighting the significance of temperature in plant growth. The authors emphasize their findings, but do not fully address potential implications or limitations of their research.\n\nRecommendations for Future Research:\nBased on this review, I recommend further research to:\n\n1. Investigate potential interactions between temperature regimes and light exposure.\n2. Examine the effects of different temperature regimes on plant stress responses.\n3. Develop more detailed models to predict plant growth under various temperature conditions.\n\nOverall, this study contributes to our understanding of temperature's impact on plant growth. However, its limitations highlight the need for further research to fully explore this topic.\n\nRating: 7.5/10\n\nNote: The rating is based on the quality of research, methodology, results, discussion, and overall impact of the study.\n\nPlease let me know if you want me to generate another paper for me to review.",

Though the Transformer architecture has fundamentally no limits on the input sequence lengths it can process, the choice of position encoding used during training can limit the performance of these models on longer inputs. We propose a novel functional relative position encoding with progressive interpolation, FIRE, to improve Transformer generalization to longer contexts. We theoretically prove that this can represent some of the popular relative position encodings, such as T5\u2019s RPE, Alibi, and Kerple. We next empirically show that FIRE models have better generalization to longer contexts on both zero-shot language modeling and long text benchmarks.",

We analyze data from 20 years of field observations, covering a range of habitats, including coral reefs, tropical forests, and grasslands. Our results show a significant increase in species richness decline, especially in coral reefs, where we observed a 30% reduction in species diversity. We also found that the rate of species loss accelerates under warmer temperatures, with a 20% increase in extinction risk for tropical species. Our findings suggest that climate change is a major contributor to biodiversity loss in tropical ecosystems.\n\nIntroduction:\nClimate change has been widely recognized as a major driver of biodiversity loss. However, the extent of this impact is not fully understood. In this study, we aim to investigate the effects of climate change on biodiversity loss in tropical ecosystems. Tropical ecosystems, including coral reefs, tropical forests, and grasslands, are particularly susceptible to the impacts of climate change.\n\nMethods:\nOur study used a combination of field observations, remote sensing, and statistical analysis to examine the effects of climate change on biodiversity loss. We collected data from 20 years of field observations, covering a range of habitats, including coral reefs, tropical forests, and grasslands. We also used remote sensing data to analyze changes in land cover and vegetation patterns.\n\nResults:\nOur results show a significant increase in species richness decline, especially in coral reefs, where we observed a 30% reduction in species diversity. We also found that the rate of species loss accelerates under warmer temperatures, with a 20% increase in extinction risk for tropical species. Our findings suggest that climate change is a major contributor to biodiversity loss in tropical ecosystems.\n\nDiscussion:\nOur results support the hypothesis that climate change is a major contributor to biodiversity loss in tropical ecosystems. However, our study also highlights the need for further research on the specific mechanisms by which climate change affects biodiversity loss in tropical ecosystems. Further studies are needed to better understand the complex interactions between climate change, land use, and species distribution.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, our study provides strong evidence that climate change is a major contributor to biodiversity loss in tropical ecosystems. Our findings suggest that warmer temperatures increase the extinction risk for tropical species, leading to a decline in species richness. We recommend further research to better understand the complex interactions between climate change, land use, and species distribution.\n\nPeer Review:\n**Major Comments:**\n\n* While the study's findings are consistent with existing research on climate change's impact on biodiversity, the study's conclusions are not particularly original or groundbreaking.\n* The study relies heavily on field observations, but the analysis of remote sensing data is not clearly explained.\n* The study does not adequately address the limitations of the study's design, including the limited number of habitats studied.\n\n**Minor Comments:**\n\n* Some of the sentences in the introduction are wordy or awkwardly phrased.\n* In the results section, the sentence \"Our findings suggest that climate change is a major contributor to biodiversity loss in tropical ecosystems\" is repeated verbatim from the abstract.\n* In the discussion section, the sentence \"Further studies are needed to better understand the complex interactions between climate change, land use, and species distribution\" is also repeated verbatim from the abstract.\n* Some of the statistical analyses are not clearly explained or justified.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n* Consider adding more originality to the study's conclusions by exploring new avenues of research or proposing specific policy recommendations.\n* Provide a more detailed explanation of the analysis of remote sensing data, including the specific methods used.\n* Discuss the limitations of the study's design in more depth, including the potential biases or confounding variables.\n* Consider adding more diversity to the habitats studied, including other types of tropical ecosystems.\n* Clarify the results section by rephrasing or reorganizing sentences to avoid repetition.\n\n**Rating:**\n\n* Overall, the study is of moderate quality, with a clear research question, a reasonable methodology, and a coherent structure.\n* However, the study's conclusions are not particularly original or groundbreaking, and the analysis of remote sensing data is not clearly explained.\n* I would rate this study a 6 out of 10.",

We motivate our work by the inadequacy of existing methods for capturing the evolving graph spectra, which are also computationally expensive due to the temporal aspect along with the graph vertex domain. We view the problem as an optimization over the Laplacian of the continuous time dynamic graph. Additionally, we propose pseudo-spectrum relaxations that decompose the transformation process, making it highly computationally efficient. The EFT method adeptly captures the evolving graph\u2019s structural and positional properties, making it effective for downstream tasks on evolving graphs. Hence, as a reference implementation, we develop a simple neural model induced with EFT for capturing evolving graph spectra. We empirically validate our theoretical findings on a number of large-scale and standard temporal graph benchmarks and demonstrate that our model achieves state-of-the-art performance.",

        "title": "LIPSCHITZ SINGULARITIES IN DIFFUSION MODELS",
        "abstract": "Diffusion models, which employ stochastic differential equations to sample images through integrals, have emerged as a dominant class of generative models. However, the rationality of the diffusion process itself receives limited attention, leaving the question of whether the problem is well-posed and well-conditioned. In this paper, we explore a perplexing tendency of diffusion models: they often display the infinite Lipschitz property of the network with respect to time variable near the zero point. We provide theoretical proofs to illustrate the presence of infinite Lipschitz constants and empirical results to confirm it. The Lipschitz singularities pose a threat to the stability and accuracy during both the training and inference processes of diffusion models. Therefore, the mitigation of Lipschitz singularities holds great potential for enhancing the performance of diffusion models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach, dubbed E-TSDM, which alleviates the Lipschitz singularities of the diffusion model near the zero point of timesteps. Remarkably, our technique yields a substantial improvement in performance. Moreover, as a byproduct of our method, we achieve a dramatic reduction in the Fr\u00e9chet Inception Distance of acceleration methods relying on network Lipschitz, including DDIM and DPM-Solver, by over 33%. Extensive experiments on diverse datasets validate our theory and method. Our work may advance the understanding of the general diffusion process, and also provide insights for the design of diffusion models.",

        "title": "UNKNOWN DOMAIN INCONSISTENCY MINIMIZATION FOR DOMAIN GENERALIZATION",
        "abstract": "The objective of domain generalization (DG) is to enhance the transferability of the model learned from a source domain to unobserved domains. To prevent overfitting to a specific domain, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) reduces source domain\u2019s loss sharpness. Although SAM variants have delivered significant improvements in DG, we highlight that there\u2019s still potential for improvement in generalizing to unknown domains through the exploration on data space. This paper introduces an objective rooted in both parameter and data perturbed regions for domain generalization, coined Unknown Domain Inconsistency Minimization (UDIM). UDIM reduces the loss landscape inconsistency between source domain and unknown domains. As unknown domains are inaccessible, these domains are empirically crafted by perturbing instances from the source domain dataset. In particular, by aligning the loss landscape acquired in the source domain to the loss landscape of perturbed domains, we expect to achieve generalization grounded on these flat minima for the unknown domains. Theoretically, we validate that merging SAM optimization with the UDIM objective establishes an upper bound for the true objective of the DG task. In an empirical aspect, UDIM consistently outperforms SAM variants across multiple DG benchmark datasets. Notably, UDIM shows statistically significant improvements in scenarios with more restrictive domain information, underscoring UDIM\u2019s generalization capability in unseen domains.

        "abstract": "Imposing known physical constraints, such as conservation laws, during neural network training introduces an inductive bias that can improve accuracy, reliability, convergence, and data efficiency for modeling physical dynamics. While such constraints can be softly imposed via loss function penalties, recent advancements in differentiable physics and optimization improve performance by incorporating PDE-constrained optimization as individual layers in neural networks. This enables a stricter adherence to physical constraints. However, imposing hard constraints significantly increases computational and memory costs, especially for complex dynamical systems. This is because it requires solving an optimization problem over a large number of points in a mesh, representing spatial and temporal discretizations, which greatly increases the complexity of the constraint. To address this challenge, we develop a scalable approach to enforce hard physical constraints using Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), which can be used with any neural network architecture. Our approach imposes the constraint over smaller decomposed domains, each of which is solved by an \u201cexpert\u201d through differentiable optimization. During training, each expert independently performs a localized backpropagation step by leveraging the implicit function theorem; the independence of each expert allows for parallelization across multiple GPUs. Compared to standard differentiable optimization, our scalable approach achieves greater accuracy in the neural PDE solver setting for predicting the dynamics of challenging non-linear systems. We also improve training stability and require significantly less computation time during both training and inference stages.",

These studies provide valuable insights into the potential of their approach in treating diabetes mellitus.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Lack of Control Groups:** The authors have only included positive control groups in their in vivo studies. It would be beneficial to include negative control groups to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the results.\n2. **Limited Sample Size:** The authors have only used a small sample size of 10 mice in their in vivo studies. A larger sample size would be necessary to confirm the results and ensure that the findings can be generalized to humans.\n3. **Unclear Dose-Response Relationship:** The authors have not clearly defined the dose-response relationship between the gene therapy and nanoparticle-based delivery and the therapeutic outcomes. This makes it difficult to predict the optimal dose and administration strategy.\n4. **Mechanisms of Action:** While the authors have proposed a multi-targeted strategy, they have not clearly defined the mechanisms of action of their approach. This makes it difficult to understand how the gene therapy and nanoparticle-based delivery work together to achieve therapeutic outcomes.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Incorporate Negative Control Groups:** The authors should include negative control groups in their in vivo studies to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the results.\n2. **Increase Sample Size:** The authors should use a larger sample size of at least 20-30 mice in their in vivo studies to confirm the results and ensure that the findings can be generalized to humans.\n3. **Define Dose-Response Relationship:** The authors should clearly define the dose-response relationship between the gene therapy and nanoparticle-based delivery and the therapeutic outcomes.\n4. **Mechanisms of Action:** The authors should clearly define the mechanisms of action of their approach, including the role of gene therapy and nanoparticle-based delivery in improving insulin sensitivity and reducing blood sugar levels.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, the paper \"Development of a Novel Therapeutic Approach for Treating Diabetes Mellitus: A Multi-Targeted Strategy Involving Gene Therapy and Nanoparticle-Based Delivery\" presents a novel therapeutic approach for treating diabetes mellitus. While the approach is innovative and worth investigating further, there are several weaknesses that need to be addressed. The authors should incorporate negative control groups, increase the sample size, define the dose-response relationship, and clearly define the mechanisms of action to provide a more comprehensive and rigorous evaluation of their approach.",

        "title": "GOAL-CONDITIONED REINFORCEMENT LEARNING",
        "abstract": "Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) is tasked with learning to achieve multiple goals in an environment purely from offline datasets using sparse reward functions. Offline GCRL is pivotal for developing generalist agents capable of leveraging pre-existing datasets to learn diverse and reusable skills without hand-engineering reward functions. However, contemporary approaches to GCRL based on supervised learning and contrastive learning are often suboptimal in the offline setting. An alternative perspective on GCRL optimizes for occupancy matching, but necessitates learning a discriminator, which subsequently serves as a pseudo-reward for downstream RL. Inaccuracies in the learned discriminator can cascade, negatively influencing the resulting policy. We present a novel approach to GCRL under a new lens of mixture-distribution matching, leading to our discriminator-free method: SMORe. The key insight is combining the occupancy matching perspective of GCRL with a convex dual formulation to derive a learning objective that can better leverage suboptimal offline data. SMORe learns scores or unnormalized densities representing the importance of taking an action at a state for reaching a particular goal. SMORe is principled and our extensive experiments on the fully offline GCRL benchmark composed of robot manipulation and locomotion tasks, including high-dimensional observations, show that SMORe can outperform state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin.",

        "abstract": "It is desirable for an agent to be able to solve a rich variety of problems that can be specified through language in the same environment. A popular approach towards obtaining such agents is to reuse skills learned in prior tasks to generalise compositionally to new ones. However, this is a challenging problem due to the curse of dimensionality induced by the combinatorially large number of ways high-level goals can be combined both logically and temporally in language. To address this problem, we propose a framework where an agent first learns a sufficient set of skill primitives to achieve all high-level goals in its environment. The agent can then flexibly compose them both logically and temporally to provably achieve temporal logic specifications in any regular language, such as regular fragments of linear temporal logic. This provides the agent with the ability to map from complex temporal logic task specifications to near-optimal behaviours zero-shot. We demonstrate this experimentally in a tabular setting, as well as in a high-dimensional video game and continuous control environment. Finally, we also demonstrate that the performance of skill machines can be improved with regular off-policy reinforcement learning algorithms when optimal behaviours are desired.",

        "abstract": "Learning surfaces from neural radiance field (NeRF) became a rising topic in Multi-View Stereo (MVS). Recent Signed Distance Function (SDF)\u2013based methods demonstrated their ability to reconstruct accurate 3D shapes of Lambertian scenes. However, their results on reflective scenes are unsatisfactory due to the entanglement of specular radiance and complicated geometry. To address the challenges, we propose a Gaussian-based representation of normals in SDF fields. Supervised by polarization priors, this representation guides the learning of geometry behind the specular reflection and captures more details than existing methods. Moreover, we propose a reweighting strategy in the optimization process to alleviate the noise issue of polarization priors. To validate the effectiveness of our design, we capture polarimetric information, and ground truth meshes in additional reflective scenes with various geometry. We also evaluated our framework on the PANDORA dataset. Comparisons prove our method outperforms existing neural 3D reconstruction methods in reflective scenes by a large margin.",

The concept bottleneck layer partitions the generative model into three parts: the pre-concept bottleneck portion, the CB layer, and the post-concept bottleneck portion. To train CB generative models, we complement the traditional task-based loss function for training generative models with a concept loss and an orthogonality loss. The CB layer and these loss terms are model agnostic, which we demonstrate by applying the CB layer to three different families of generative models: generative adversarial networks, variational autoencoders, and diffusion models. On multiple datasets across different types of generative models, steering a generative model, with the CB layer, outperforms all baselines\u2014in some cases, it is 10 times more effective. In addition, we show how the CB layer can be used to interpret the output of the generative model and debug the model during or post training.",

NeuroPro is a small molecule inhibitor of the enzyme monoamine oxidase (MAO) and has shown promising results in preclinical studies. We report here the results of a phase I clinical trial, which demonstrated the safety and efficacy of NeuroPro for the treatment of early-stage Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease. Our results suggest that NeuroPro may offer a new therapeutic option for patients with these debilitating diseases.\n\n**Introduction:**\nNeurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, are characterized by the progressive loss of neurons and the accumulation of toxic proteins. Current treatments for these diseases are often ineffective and can have significant side effects. The development of a novel therapeutic agent that can target the underlying mechanisms of these diseases is therefore a critical need.\n\n**Methods:**\nOur study used a combination of preclinical and clinical trial designs to evaluate the safety and efficacy of NeuroPro. Preclinical studies were conducted using mouse models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. Clinical trial participants were randomly assigned to receive either NeuroPro or a placebo. The primary outcome measure was the change in cognitive function, as assessed by the modified mini-mental state examination (MMSE).\n\n**Results:**\nOur preclinical studies demonstrated that NeuroPro significantly reduced the accumulation of amyloid beta and tau proteins, which are key contributors to the pathogenesis of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The clinical trial results showed that NeuroPro significantly improved cognitive function and reduced symptoms of Parkinson's disease. There were no significant adverse effects observed.\n\n**Discussion:**\nOur results suggest that NeuroPro may offer a new therapeutic option for patients with Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. The mechanism of action of NeuroPro, which involves the inhibition of MAO, may provide a novel target for the treatment of these diseases. Further studies are needed to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of NeuroPro.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrates the safety and efficacy of NeuroPro for the treatment of early-stage Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases. We believe that NeuroPro may offer a new therapeutic option for patients with these debilitating diseases.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Overall Impression:**\nThis study presents a promising result for the development of a novel therapeutic agent for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases. The authors have demonstrated the safety and efficacy of NeuroPro using a combination of preclinical and clinical trial designs.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* The study design is well-structured, with a clear preclinical and clinical trial protocol.\n* The results of the preclinical studies are impressive, demonstrating significant reductions in amyloid beta and tau protein accumulation.\n* The clinical trial results are also encouraging, with significant improvements in cognitive function and symptoms of Parkinson's disease.\n\n**Limitations:**\n\n* The study has a small sample size, which may limit the external validity of the results.\n* The study only evaluated the efficacy of NeuroPro for early-stage Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases, and further studies are needed to evaluate its efficacy for more advanced stages of these diseases.\n* The study did not evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of NeuroPro, which is a critical consideration for the development of any therapeutic agent.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* The authors should consider conducting a larger, multicenter clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of NeuroPro for more advanced stages of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's diseases.\n* Further studies should evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of NeuroPro, including its effects on cognitive function, motor function, and quality of life.\n* The authors should also consider conducting studies to evaluate the potential mechanisms of action of NeuroPro and its interactions with other therapeutic agents.\n\n**Rating:**\n\n* Overall, I would rate this study as high quality, with a clear and well-structured protocol and impressive results from the preclinical and clinical trials.\n* However, I would give the study a rating of 7 out of 10, due to the limitations mentioned above.\n\n**Recommendation to Authors:**\n\n* I would recommend that the authors revise the manuscript to address the limitations mentioned above, including the small sample size and the need for further studies to evaluate the long-term efficacy and safety of NeuroPro.\n* I would also recommend that the authors consider conducting additional studies to evaluate the potential mechanisms of action of NeuroPro and its interactions with other therapeutic agents.",

        "abstract": "Recent advancements in autonomous driving have relied on data-driven approaches, which are widely adopted but face challenges including dataset bias, overfitting, and uninterpretability. Drawing inspiration from the knowledge-driven nature of human driving, we explore the question of how to instill similar capabilities into autonomous driving systems and summarize a paradigm that integrates an interactive environment, a driver agent, as well as a memory component to address this question. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) with emergent abilities, we propose the DiLu framework, which combines a Reasoning and a Reflection module to enable the system to perform decision-making based on common-sense knowledge and evolve continuously. Extensive experiments prove DiLu\u2019s capability to accumulate experience and demonstrate a significant advantage in generalization ability over reinforcement learning-based methods. Moreover, DiLu is able to directly acquire experiences from real-world datasets which highlights its potential to be deployed on practical autonomous driving systems. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to leverage knowledge-driven capability in decision-making for autonomous vehicles. Through the proposed DiLu framework, LLM is strengthened to apply knowledge and to reason causally in the autonomous driving domain. Project page: https://pjlab-adg.github.io/DiLu/",

        "title": "GENERALIZATION: UNRAVELING LEARNING DIFFER-",
        "abstract": "This paper investigates discrepancies in how neural networks learn from different imaging domains, which are commonly overlooked when adopting computer vision techniques from the domain of natural images to other specialized domains such as medical images. Recent works have found that the generalization error of a trained network typically increases with the intrinsic dimension (ddata) of its training set. Yet, the steepness of this relationship varies significantly between medical (radiological) and natural imaging domains, with no existing theoretical explanation. We address this gap in knowledge by establishing and empirically validating a generalization scaling law with respect to ddata, and propose that the substantial scaling discrepancy between the two considered domains may be at least partially attributed to the higher intrinsic \u201clabel sharpness\u201d (KF ) of medical imaging datasets, a metric which we propose. Next, we demonstrate an additional benefit of measuring the label sharpness of a training set: it is negatively correlated with the trained model\u2019s adversarial robustness, which notably leads to models for medical images having a substantially higher vulnerability to adversarial attack. Finally, we extend our ddata formalism to the related metric of learned representation intrinsic dimension (drepr), derive a generalization scaling law with respect to drepr, and show that ddata serves as an upper bound for drepr. Our theoretical results are supported by thorough experiments with six models and eleven natural and medical imaging datasets over a range of training set sizes. Our findings offer insights into the influence of intrinsic dataset properties on generalization, representation learning, and robustness in deep neural networks.1",

Nonetheless, these existing transformer-based methods often neglect an essential aspect: the incorporation of uncertainty into the predicted series, which holds significant value in decisionmaking. In this paper, we introduce a Transformer-Modulated Diffusion Model (TMDM), uniting conditional diffusion generative process with transformers into a unified framework to enable precise distribution forecasting for MTS. TMDM harnesses the power of transformers to extract essential insights from historical time series data. This information is then utilized as prior knowledge, capturing covariate-dependence in both the forward and reverse processes within the diffusion model. Furthermore, we seamlessly integrate well-designed transformerbased forecasting methods into TMDM to enhance its overall performance. Additionally, we introduce two novel metrics for evaluating uncertainty estimation performance. Through extensive experiments on six datasets using four evaluation metrics, we establish the effectiveness of TMDM in probabilistic MTS forecasting.",

        "abstract": "We deal with the combinatorial problem of learning directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure from observational data adhering to a linear structural equation model (SEM). Leveraging advances in differentiable, nonconvex characterizations of acyclicity, recent efforts have advocated a continuous constrained optimization paradigm to efficiently explore the space of DAGs. Most existing methods employ lasso-type score functions to guide this search, which (i) require expensive penalty parameter retuning when the unknown SEM noise variances change across problem instances; and (ii) implicitly rely on limiting homoscedasticity assumptions. In this work, we propose a new convex score function for sparsity-aware learning of linear DAGs, which incorporates concomitant estimation of scale and thus effectively decouples the sparsity parameter from the exogenous noise levels. Regularization via a smooth, nonconvex acyclicity penalty term yields CoLiDE (Concomitant Linear DAG Estimation), a regression-based criterion amenable to efficient gradient computation and closed-form estimation of noise variances in heteroscedastic scenarios. Our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods without incurring added complexity, especially when the DAGs are larger and the noise level profile is heterogeneous. We also find CoLiDE exhibits enhanced stability manifested via reduced standard deviations in several domain-specific metrics, underscoring the robustness of our novel linear DAG estimator.",

        "abstract": "Addressing the limitations of text as a source of accurate layout representation in text-conditional diffusion models, many works incorporate additional signals to condition certain attributes within a generated image. Although successful, previous works do not account for the specific localization of said attributes extended into the three dimensional plane. In this context, we present a conditional diffusion model that integrates control over three-dimensional object placement with disentangled representations of global stylistic semantics from multiple exemplar images. Specifically, we first introduce depth disentanglement training to leverage the relative depth of objects as an estimator, allowing the model to identify the absolute positions of unseen objects through the use of synthetic image triplets. We also introduce soft guidance, a method for imposing global semantics onto targeted regions without the use of any additional localization cues. Our integrated framework, COMPOSE AND CONQUER (CNC), unifies these techniques to localize multiple conditions in a disentangled manner. We demonstrate that our approach allows perception of objects at varying depths while offering a versatile framework for composing localized objects with different global semantics.",

        "abstract": "Elliptic partial differential equations (PDEs) are a major class of time-independent PDEs that play a key role in many scientific and engineering domains such as fluid dynamics, plasma physics, and solid mechanics. Recently, neural operators have emerged as a promising technique to solve elliptic PDEs more efficiently by directly mapping the input to solutions. However, existing networks typically cannot handle complex geometries and inhomogeneous boundary values present in the real world. Here we introduce Boundary-Embedded Neural Operators (BENO), a novel neural operator architecture that embeds the complex geometries and inhomogeneous boundary values into the solving of elliptic PDEs. Inspired by classical Green\u2019s function, BENO consists of two branches of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for interior source term and boundary values, respectively. Furthermore, a Transformer encoder maps the global boundary geometry into a latent vector which influences each message passing layer of the GNNs. We test our model extensively in elliptic PDEs with various boundary conditions. We show that all existing baseline methods fail to learn the solution operator. In contrast, our model, endowed with boundary-embedded architecture, outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators and strong baselines by an average of 60.96%.

The authors suggest that by manipulating microRNA expression levels, they can target specific disease-causing pathways, thereby preventing disease progression. The proposed approach involves the use of synthetic microRNA mimics that are engineered to target specific disease-related microRNA sequences. The authors report encouraging preliminary results from animal studies, suggesting that this approach may be effective for treating neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). However, further studies are needed to fully validate the efficacy of this approach.\n\n**Peer Review**\n\n**Introduction**\n\nThe paper presents a novel therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases using microRNA-based delivery systems. The authors provide a comprehensive review of the underlying biology of microRNA regulation, highlighting the potential of microRNA manipulation for disease treatment. However, the introduction could benefit from more specific examples of neurodegenerative diseases that have been successfully treated with microRNA-based approaches.\n\n**Methods**\n\nThe authors describe a multi-step process for designing, synthesizing, and validating synthetic microRNA mimics. While the methodology is well-described, there are some concerns regarding the lack of detail on the specific sequences used for targeting disease-related microRNA sequences. The authors suggest that the use of a bioinformatic approach to predict the efficacy of different microRNA mimics could be beneficial. Furthermore, the authors do not provide sufficient information on the delivery mechanisms used to introduce the microRNA mimics into the target cells.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe authors report encouraging preliminary results from animal studies, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed microRNA-based delivery system for treating neurodegenerative diseases. However, the results are based on a limited number of animal models, which may not be representative of human disease. Additionally, the authors do not provide sufficient information on the dosage of the microRNA mimics used, the duration of treatment, and the specific outcomes measured.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nThe authors conclude that their proposed microRNA-based delivery system has shown promise for treating neurodegenerative diseases. However, further studies are needed to fully validate the efficacy of this approach. The authors suggest that a randomized, controlled trial using human subjects would be a critical next step.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nBased on the manuscript, I would recommend the following improvements for the authors to consider:\n\n1. Provide more specific examples of neurodegenerative diseases that have been successfully treated with microRNA-based approaches.\n2. Elaborate on the bioinformatic approach used to predict the efficacy of different microRNA mimics.\n3. Provide more detail on the delivery mechanisms used to introduce the microRNA mimics into the target cells.\n4. Report the results of the animal studies using a more robust experimental design, including a larger number of animal models, a more comprehensive range of outcomes, and a more detailed analysis of the data.\n5. Suggest a randomized, controlled trial using human subjects as a critical next step to fully validate the efficacy of this approach.\n\n**Confidentiality**\n\nThis peer review is confidential, as per the instructions provided.\n\n**Rating**\n\nI would rate this manuscript as \"conditionally accepted\" based on the recommendations provided above. The manuscript presents an innovative approach to treating neurodegenerative diseases using microRNA-based delivery systems, but further studies are needed to fully validate the efficacy of this approach.\n\n**Additional Comments**\n\nThe manuscript is well-written, with a clear introduction, methods, results, and conclusion. The authors provide a comprehensive review of the underlying biology of microRNA regulation, highlighting the potential of microRNA manipulation for disease treatment. However, the manuscript could benefit from more specific examples of neurodegenerative diseases that have been successfully treated with microRNA-based approaches, as well as more detailed information on the experimental design used to validate the efficacy of the proposed approach.",

        "abstract": "Programming-by-example is the task of synthesizing a program that is consistent with a set of user-provided input-output examples. As examples are often an under-specification of one\u2019s intent, a good synthesizer must choose the intended program from the many that are consistent with the given set of examples. Prior work frames program synthesis as a cooperative game between a listener (that synthesizes programs) and a speaker (a user choosing examples), and shows that models of computational pragmatic inference are effective in choosing the user intended programs. However, these models require counterfactual reasoning over a large set of programs and examples, which is infeasible in realistic program spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel way to amortize this search with neural networks. We sample pairs of programs and examples via self-play between listener and speaker models, and use pragmatic inference to choose informative training examples from this sample. We then use the informative dataset to train models to improve the synthesizer\u2019s ability to disambiguate user-provided examples without human supervision. We validate our method on the challenging task of synthesizing regular expressions from example strings, and find that our method (1) outperforms models trained without choosing pragmatic examples by 23% (a 51% relative increase) (2) matches the performance of supervised learning on a dataset of pragmatic examples provided by humans, despite using no human data in training.",

The authors used a combination of statistical and modeling techniques to analyze data from 200 countries and 50 years of time series data. The results show that global warming has significantly reduced food availability, increased food prices, and decreased food access, particularly in developing countries.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Overall Assessment:** The study's contribution to the existing literature on the impact of climate change on food security is significant, and the authors' use of a combination of statistical and modeling techniques is commendable. However, the study's findings and methodology require further validation and critical evaluation.\n\n**Methodology:** The study's methodology is generally sound, but there are some limitations. The authors used a combination of statistical and modeling techniques, but the specific methods used are not clearly explained. The study's data sources are not specified, and it is unclear how the authors ensured the quality and reliability of the data. Additionally, the study's analysis is limited to a 50-year time period, and it is unclear how the authors accounted for non-linear effects and feedback loops.\n\n**Results:** The study's findings are clear and straightforward, but they are not particularly surprising.

Yet, these models have numerous drawbacks, including their potential to generate images featuring sexually explicit content, mirror artistic styles without permission, or even hallucinate (or deepfake) the likenesses of celebrities. Consequently, various methods have been proposed in order to \u201cerase\u201d sensitive concepts from text-to-image models. In this work, we examine seven recently proposed concept erasure methods, and show that targeted concepts are not fully excised from any of these methods. Specifically, we devise an algorithm to learn special input word embeddings that can retrieve \u201cerased\u201d concepts from the sanitized models with no alterations to their weights. Our results highlight the brittleness of post hoc concept erasure methods, and call into question their use in the algorithmic toolkit for AI safety.",

        "abstract": "K-means clustering is a widely used machine learning method for identifying patterns in large datasets. Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations have recently been proposed for solving the K-means optimization problem that enjoy strong statistical optimality guarantees, but the prohibitive cost of implementing an SDP solver renders these guarantees inaccessible to practical datasets. By contrast, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a simple clustering algorithm that is widely used by machine learning practitioners, but without a solid statistical underpinning nor rigorous guarantees. In this paper, we describe an NMF-like algorithm that works by solving a nonnegative low-rank restriction of the SDP relaxed K-means formulation using a nonconvex Burer\u2013Monteiro factorization approach. The resulting algorithm is just as simple and scalable as state-of-theart NMF algorithms, while also enjoying the same strong statistical optimality guarantees as the SDP. In our experiments, we observe that our algorithm achieves substantially smaller mis-clustering errors compared to the existing state-of-the-art.",

This study proposes a novel approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases using microRNA-based gene editing. We used CRISPR-Cas9 system to introduce microRNAs (miRNAs) into neurons, which can modulate the expression of target genes involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Our results show that miRNA-based gene editing can effectively reduce the expression of disease-associated genes and improve neuronal function in vitro and in vivo models. These findings suggest that microRNA-based gene editing may be a promising therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Introduction:**\nThe introduction is clear and concise, providing an overview of the importance of developing novel therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative diseases. However, it would be beneficial to provide more context on the current state of research in this field and the limitations of existing treatments.\n\n**Methods:**\nThe methods section provides a detailed description of the CRISPR-Cas9 system and miRNA-based gene editing approach. However, it would be helpful to provide more information on the specific miRNAs used, the target genes, and the in vitro and in vivo models employed.

        "title": "SLICEGPT: COMPRESS LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS",
        "abstract": "Large language models have become the cornerstone of natural language processing, but their use comes with substantial costs in terms of compute and memory resources. Sparsification provides a solution to alleviate these resource constraints, and recent works have shown that trained models can be sparsified post-hoc. Existing sparsification techniques face challenges as they need additional data structures and offer constrained speedup with current hardware. In this paper we present SliceGPT, a new post-training sparsification scheme which replaces each weight matrix with a smaller (dense) matrix, reducing the embedding dimension of the network. Through extensive experimentation, we show that SliceGPT can remove up to 25% of the model parameters (including embeddings) for OPT 66B and LLAMA-2 70B models with modest loss in accuracy (superior to 2:4 sparsity). Our sliced models run on fewer GPUs and run faster without any additional code optimization: on 24GB consumer GPUs we reduce the total compute for inference on LLAMA-2 70B to 64% of that of the dense model; on 40GB A100 GPUs we reduce it to 66%. We offer a new insight, computational invariance in transformer networks, which enables SliceGPT and we hope it will inspire and enable future avenues to reduce memory and computation demands for pre-trained models.",

        "abstract": "In federated learning (FL), data heterogeneity is one key bottleneck that causes model divergence and limits performance. Addressing this, existing methods often regard data heterogeneity as an inherent property and propose to mitigate its adverse effects by correcting models. In this paper, we seek to break this inherent property by generating data to complement the original dataset to fundamentally mitigate heterogeneity level. As a novel attempt from the perspective of data, we propose federated learning with consensus-oriented generation (FedCOG). FedCOG consists of two key components at the client side: complementary data generation, which generates data extracted from the shared global model to complement the original dataset, and knowledge-distillation-based model training, which distills knowledge from global model to local model based on the generated data to mitigate over-fitting the original heterogeneous dataset. FedCOG has two critical advantages: 1) it can be a plug-and-play module to further improve the performance of most existing FL methods, and 2) it is naturally compatible with standard FL protocols such as Secure Aggregation since it makes no modification in communication process. Extensive experiments on classical and real-world FL datasets show that FedCOG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods .",

        "title": "LMUFORMER: LOW COMPLEXITY YET POWERFUL SPIKING MODEL WITH LEGENDRE MEMORY UNITS",
        "abstract": "Transformer models have demonstrated high accuracy in numerous applications but have high complexity and lack sequential processing capability making them ill-suited for many streaming applications at the edge where devices are heavily resource-constrained. Thus motivated, many researchers have proposed reformulating the transformer models as RNN modules which modify the self-attention computation with explicit states. However, these approaches often incur significant performance degradation. The ultimate goal is to develop a model that has the following properties: parallel training, streaming and low-cost inference, and state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. In this paper, we propose a new direction to achieve this goal. We show how architectural modifications to a fully-sequential recurrent model can help push its performance toward Transformer models while retaining its sequential processing capability. Specifically, inspired by the recent success of Legendre Memory Units (LMU) in sequence learning tasks, we propose LMUFormer, which augments the LMU with convolutional patch embedding and convolutional channel mixer. Moreover, we present a spiking version of this architecture, which introduces the benefit of states within the patch embedding and channel mixer modules while simultaneously reducing the computing complexity. We evaluated our architectures on multiple sequence datasets. Of particular note is our performance on the Speech Commands V2 dataset (35 classes). In comparison to SOTA transformer-based models within the ANN domain, our LMUFormer demonstrates comparable performance while necessitating a remarkable 53\u00d7 reduction in parameters and a substantial 65\u00d7 decrement in FLOPs. Furthermore, when benchmarked against extant low-complexity SNN variants, our model establishes a new SOTA with an accuracy of 96.12%. Additionally, owing to our model\u2019s proficiency in real-time data processing, we are able to achieve a 32.03% reduction in sequence length, all while incurring an inconsequential decline in performance. Our code is publicly available here.",

        "abstract": "Diffusion models are capable of generating impressive images conditioned on text descriptions, and extensions of these models allow users to edit images at a relatively coarse scale. However, the ability to precisely edit the layout, position, pose, and shape of objects in images with diffusion models is still difficult. To this end, we propose motion guidance, a zero-shot technique that allows a user to specify dense, complex motion fields that indicate where each pixel in an image should move. Motion guidance works by steering the diffusion sampling process with the gradients through an off-the-shelf optical flow network. Specifically, we design a guidance loss that encourages the sample to have the desired motion, as estimated by a flow network, while also being visually similar to the source image. By simultaneously sampling from a diffusion model and guiding the sample to have low guidance loss, we can obtain a motion-edited image. We demonstrate that our technique works on complex motions and produces high quality edits of real and generated images.",

While various methods have been developed to address this confounding issue, they often rely on strong assumptions about the underlying causal structure. In this paper, we consider a general scenario where measured and latent variables collectively form a partially observed causally sufficient linear system and latent variables may be anywhere in the causal structure. We theoretically show that with the aid of high-order statistics, the causal graph is (almost) fully identifiable if, roughly speaking, each latent set has a sufficient number of pure children, which can be either latent or measured. Naturally, LiNGAM, a model without latent variables, is encompassed as a special case. Based on the identification theorem, we develop a principled algorithm to identify the causal graph by testing for statistical independence involving only measured variables in specific manners. Experimental results show that our method effectively recovers the causal structure, even when latent variables are influenced by measured variables.",

We also study both time and particle discretization regimes and prove a new uniform-in-time propagation of chaos result which accounts for the dependency of the particle interactions on all previous distributions. Furthermore, we propose mean-field Langevin anchored best response (MFL-ABR), a symmetric double-loop algorithm based on best response dynamics with linear last-iterate convergence.

        "abstract": "Generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) data or unseen domain, termed OOD generalization, still lacks appropriate theoretical guarantees. Canonical OOD bounds focus on different distance measurements between source and target domains but fail to consider the optimization property of the learned model. As empirically shown in recent work, the sharpness of learned minima influences OOD generalization. To bridge this gap between optimization and OOD generalization, we study the effect of sharpness on how a model tolerates data change in domain shift which is usually captured by \"robustness\" in generalization. In this paper, we give a rigorous connection between sharpness and robustness, which gives better OOD guarantees for robust algorithms. It also provides a theoretical backing for \"flat minima leads to better OOD generalization\". Overall, we propose a sharpness-based OOD generalization bound by taking robustness into consideration, resulting in a tighter bound than non-robust guarantees. Our findings are supported by the experiments on a ridge regression model, as well as the experiments on deep learning classification tasks.",

        "abstract": "Generative models have shown remarkable progress in 3D aspect. Recent works learn 3D representation explicitly under text-3D guidance. However, limited text3D data restricts the vocabulary scale and text control of generations. Generators may easily fall into a stereotype concept for certain text prompts, thus losing openvocabulary generation ability. To tackle this issue, we introduce a conditional 3D generative model, namely TextField3D.Specifically, rather than using the text prompts as input directly, we suggest to inject dynamic noise into the latent space of given text prompts, i.e., Noisy Text Fields (NTFs). In this way, limited 3D data can be mapped to the appropriate range of textual latent space that is expanded by NTFs. To this end, an NTFGen module is proposed to model general text latent code in noisy fields. Meanwhile, an NTFBind module is proposed to align viewinvariant image latent code to noisy fields, further supporting image-conditional 3D generation. To guide the conditional generation in both geometry and texture, multi-modal discrimination is constructed with a text-3D discriminator and a text2.5D discriminator. Compared to previous methods, TextField3D includes three merits: 1) large vocabulary, 2) text consistency, and 3) low latency. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our method achieves a potential open-vocabulary 3D generation capability.",

        "abstract": "Despite many successful examples in which probabilistic inference can account for perception, we have little understanding of how the brain represents and uses structured priors that capture the complexity of natural input statistics. Here we construct a recurrent circuit model that can implicitly represent priors over latent variables, and combine them with sensory and contextual sources of information to encode task-specific posteriors. Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models as means of learning and using priors over images, our model uses dendritic nonlinearities optimized for denoising, and stochastic somatic integration with the degree of noise modulated by an oscillating global signal. Combining these elements into a recurrent network yields a dynamical system that samples from the prior at a rate prescribed by the period of the global oscillator. Additional inputs reflecting sensory or top-down contextual information alter these dynamics to generate samples from the corresponding posterior, with different input gating patterns selecting different inference tasks. We demonstrate that this architecture can sample from low dimensional nonlinear manifolds and multimodal posteriors. Overall, the model provides a new framework for circuit-level representation of probabilistic information, in a format that facilitates flexible inference.",

        "abstract": "Manifold-valued measurements exist in numerous applications within computer vision and machine learning. Recent studies have extended Deep Neural Networks (DNNs) to manifolds, and concomitantly, normalization techniques have also been adapted to several manifolds, referred to as Riemannian normalization. Nonetheless, most of the existing Riemannian normalization methods have been derived in an ad hoc manner and only apply to specific manifolds. This paper establishes a unified framework for Riemannian Batch Normalization (RBN) techniques on Lie groups. Our framework offers the theoretical guarantee of controlling both the Riemannian mean and variance. Empirically, we focus on Symmetric Positive Definite (SPD) manifolds, which possess three distinct types of Lie group structures. Using the deformation concept, we generalize the existing Lie groups on SPD manifolds into three families of parameterized Lie groups. Specific normalization layers induced by these Lie groups are then proposed for SPD neural networks. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach through three sets of experiments: radar recognition, human action recognition, and electroencephalography (EEG) classification.

The authors provide a comprehensive overview of climate change impacts on global food security and highlight the need for innovative approaches to predict and mitigate these effects. The introduction effectively sets up the context for their proposed novel approach, integrating machine learning with crop yield data and climate models.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nThe authors propose a hybrid approach that combines machine learning algorithms with crop yield data and climate models to predict climate change impacts on global food security. The method involves data pre-processing, model selection, and evaluation using a combination of metrics. The authors utilize a range of machine learning algorithms, including random forest, gradient boosting, and support vector machine, to predict crop yields and identify key factors contributing to climate change impacts. The use of climate models, such as IPCC AR5 and CMIP5, provides a robust framework for evaluating the predictions.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results of their analysis show promising promise in terms of accuracy and robustness. The authors demonstrate that their hybrid approach outperforms traditional climate models in terms of prediction accuracy and provides a better representation of climate change impacts on global food security. The results are also consistent with existing literature, providing a strong basis for their conclusions.\n\n**Discussion and Conclusion**\n\nThe discussion and conclusion sections of the paper provide a thorough analysis of the results and their implications. The authors discuss the limitations of their approach, such as data availability and model uncertainty, and highlight potential avenues for future research. The conclusion effectively summarizes their key findings and provides recommendations for policymakers and practitioners.\n\n**Critique and Suggestions**\n\n1. The paper could benefit from a more detailed explanation of data sources and availability. The authors mention that they used a range of climate models and machine learning algorithms, but it would be useful to provide a clearer description of data sources and any limitations or biases.\n2. The authors could also explore potential applications and case studies to demonstrate the practical relevance of their approach. This would provide a stronger justification for their hybrid approach and demonstrate its potential for real-world impact.\n3. The paper could also benefit from a clearer description of model uncertainty and its implications. The authors mention model uncertainty, but it would be useful to provide a clearer explanation of how they addressed this issue and what implications it had for their results.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, this paper provides a well-structured and comprehensive contribution to the field of climate change research. The authors' novel approach to integrating machine learning with crop yield data and climate models provides a promising solution for predicting climate change impacts on global food security. While there are areas for improvement, such as data availability and model uncertainty, their approach demonstrates significant potential for practical application. The authors have provided a clear and concise paper that is well-suited for publication in a peer-reviewed journal.\n\n**Rating**\n\nI would rate this paper 8/10.

        "abstract": "Hypernetworks, neural networks that predict the parameters of another neural network, are powerful models that have been successfully used in diverse applications from image generation to multi-task learning. Unfortunately, existing hypernetworks are often challenging to train. Training typically converges far more slowly than for non-hypernetwork models, and the rate of convergence can be very sensitive to hyperparameter choices. In this work, we identify a fundamental and previously unidentified problem that contributes to the challenge of training hypernetworks: a magnitude proportionality between the inputs and outputs of the hypernetwork. We demonstrate both analytically and empirically that this can lead to unstable optimization, thereby slowing down convergence, and sometimes even preventing any learning. We present a simple solution to this problem using a revised hypernetwork formulation that we call Magnitude Invariant Parametrizations (MIP). We demonstrate the proposed solution on several hypernetwork tasks, where it consistently stabilizes training and achieves faster convergence. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive ablation study including choices of activation function, normalization strategies, input dimensionality, and hypernetwork architecture; and find that MIP improves training in all scenarios. We also provide easy-to-use code that can turn existing networks into MIP-based hypernetworks.",

        "abstract": "Due to privacy or patent concerns, a growing number of large models are released without granting access to their training data, making transferring their knowledge inefficient and problematic. In response, Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) methods have emerged as direct solutions. However, simply adopting models derived from DFKD for real-world applications suffers significant performance degradation, due to the discrepancy between teachers\u2019 training data and real-world scenarios (student domain). The degradation stems from the portions of teachers\u2019 knowledge that are not applicable to the student domain. They are specific to the teacher domain and would undermine students\u2019 performance. Hence, selectively transferring teachers\u2019 appropriate knowledge becomes the primary challenge in DFKD. In this work, we propose a simple but effective method AuG-KD. It utilizes an uncertainty-guided and sample-specific anchor to align student-domain data with the teacher domain and leverages a generative method to progressively trade off the learning process between OOD knowledge distillation and domain-specific information learning via mixup learning. Extensive experiments in 3 datasets and 8 settings demonstrate the stability and superiority of our approach. Code available at https://github.com/IshiKura-a/AuG-KD",

This study aimed to investigate the effects of different temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality. Three sets of wheat were exposed to three different temperature regimes: (1) 15\u00b0C, (2) 20\u00b0C, and (3) 25\u00b0C. Wheat yield and quality were assessed using standard agronomic and quality parameters. Our results show that the 15\u00b0C temperature regime resulted in the highest wheat yield and the best quality. We also found that the 20\u00b0C temperature regime resulted in the best protein quality. These results have significant implications for wheat production and quality control.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nWheat (Triticum aestivum) is one of the most widely cultivated crops in the world. Its yield and quality are crucial for food security and global food production. However, the effects of temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality are not well understood. Temperature regimes can affect wheat growth, development, and quality, and can have significant impacts on crop yields and quality.\n\n**Materials and Methods:**\n\n* 9 wheat plants were grown in three sets of 9 plants each.\n* Three temperature regimes were applied: 15\u00b0C, 20\u00b0C, and 25\u00b0C.\n* Wheat yield and quality were assessed using standard agronomic and quality parameters, including grain yield, protein content, and moisture content.\n* Statistical analysis were performed using ANOVA and regression analysis.\n\n**Results:**\n\nOur results show that the 15\u00b0C temperature regime resulted in the highest wheat yield (p < 0.01). However, the 20\u00b0C temperature regime resulted in the best protein quality (p < 0.05). We also found that the 15\u00b0C temperature regime resulted in the best quality (p < 0.05). Our results are consistent with previous studies, but with some differences.\n\n**Discussion:**\n\nThe results of this study show that the effects of temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality are complex and dependent on several factors. However, our results suggest that the 15\u00b0C temperature regime resulted in the highest wheat yield and the best quality. This is consistent with previous studies that have shown that cooler temperatures can improve wheat yield and quality. On the other hand, the 20\u00b0C temperature regime resulted in the best protein quality, suggesting that warmer temperatures can improve protein quality. These results have significant implications for wheat production and quality control.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe results of this study have significant implications for wheat production and quality control. Our results suggest that the 15\u00b0C temperature regime is the most beneficial for wheat yield and quality, and that the 20\u00b0C temperature regime is beneficial for protein quality. These results can be useful for farmers, breeders, and policymakers to optimize wheat production and quality control.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* Further research is needed to understand the mechanisms underlying the effects of temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality.\n* More studies are needed to validate the results of this study and to explore the potential applications of this knowledge.\n* This study highlights the importance of considering the effects of temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality, and the need for further research in this area.\n\n**Critique:**\n\n* This study had a small sample size, with only 9 plants per treatment, which may not be sufficient to capture the full range of variability in wheat yield and quality.\n* There were only three temperature regimes tested, and it is unclear whether other temperature regimes would have different effects on wheat yield and quality.\n* There were no controls for other environmental factors that may affect wheat yield and quality, such as soil moisture, soil temperature, and precipitation.\n* Statistical analysis were performed using ANOVA and regression analysis, but it is unclear whether these analyses were robust and reliable.\n* There were no discussion of the potential limitations of the study, such as the fact that the results may not be generalizable to other wheat varieties, regions, or climates.\n* There were no discussion of the potential applications of this knowledge, such as the development of new crop management strategies, improved irrigation systems, and more efficient crop production.\n\n**Major Critique:**\n\n* This study had a small sample size and limited replication, and therefore the results may not be generalizable to other wheat varieties, regions, or climates.\n* There were only three temperature regimes tested, and it is unclear whether other temperature regimes would have different effects on wheat yield and quality.\n* There were no controls for other environmental factors that may affect wheat yield and quality, and the results may be influenced by other factors that were not accounted for.\n* There were no discussion of the potential limitations of the study, and the results may not be reliable due to these limitations.\n\n**Minor Critique:**\n\n* There were some minor errors in the text, such as missing articles, incorrect verb tenses, and grammatical errors.\n* There were some minor issues with the formatting and layout of the text, such as inconsistent spacing and font sizes.\n* There were some minor issues with the citations and references, such as missing citations and incorrect citation styles.\n\n**Recommendations for Improvements:**\n\n* Use a larger sample size, with at least 27 plants per treatment, to increase the reliability and generalizability of the results.\n* Include more temperature regimes in the study, such as 10\u00b0C, 18\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C, to explore the full range of variability in wheat yield and quality.\n* Include controls for other environmental factors that may affect wheat yield and quality, such as soil moisture, soil temperature, and precipitation.\n* Use more robust statistical analyses, such as ANOVA with multiple comparisons, to ensure that the results are reliable and generalizable.\n* Discuss the potential limitations of the study, such as the fact that the results may not be generalizable to other wheat varieties, regions, or climates.\n* Discuss the potential applications of this knowledge, such as the development of new crop management strategies, improved irrigation systems, and more efficient crop production.\n\n**Rating:**\n\nBased on the critique, I would rate this paper as follows:\n\n* Scientific merit: 6/10\n* Clarity and coherence: 7/10\n* Originality and contribution: 6/10\n* Writing style: 6/10\n* Overall quality: 6/10\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nI would recommend that the authors revise and resubmit the paper based on the critiques and recommendations outlined above.",

        "abstract": "Despite the advancements of open-source large language models (LLMs), e.g., LLaMA, they remain significantly limited in tool-use capabilities, i.e., using external tools (APIs) to fulfill human instructions. The reason is that current instruction tuning largely focuses on basic language tasks but ignores the tool-use domain. This is in contrast to the excellent tool-use capabilities of state-of-the-art (SOTA) closed-source LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToolLLM, a general tool-use framework encompassing data construction, model training, and evaluation. We first present ToolBench, an instruction-tuning dataset for tool use, which is constructed automatically using ChatGPT. Specifically, the construction can be divided into three stages: (i) API collection: we collect 16, 464 real-world RESTful APIs spanning 49 categories from RapidAPI Hub; (ii) instruction generation: we prompt ChatGPT to generate diverse instructions involving these APIs, covering both single-tool and multi-tool scenarios; (iii) solution path annotation: we use ChatGPT to search for a valid solution path (chain of API calls) for each instruction. To enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we develop a novel depth-first search-based decision tree algorithm. It enables LLMs to evaluate multiple reasoning traces and expand the search space. Moreover, to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of LLMs, we develop an automatic evaluator: ToolEval. Based on ToolBench, we fine-tune LLaMA to obtain an LLM ToolLLaMA, and equip it with a neural API retriever to recommend appropriate APIs for each instruction. Experiments show that ToolLLaMA demonstrates a remarkable ability to execute complex instructions and generalize to unseen APIs, and exhibits comparable performance to ChatGPT. Our ToolLLaMA also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization ability in an out-of-distribution tool-use dataset: APIBench. The codes, trained models, and demo are publicly available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/ToolBench.",

However, we have a limited understanding of the content of these corpora, including general statistics, quality, social factors, and inclusion of evaluation data (contamination). In this work, we propose WHAT\u2019S IN MY BIG DATA? (WIMBD), a platform and a set of sixteen analyses that allow us to reveal and compare the contents of large text corpora. WIMBD builds on two basic capabilities\u2014count and search\u2014at scale, which allows us to analyze more than 35 terabytes on a standard compute node. We apply WIMBD to ten different corpora used to train popular language models, including C4, The Pile, and RedPajama. Our analysis uncovers several surprising and previously undocumented findings about these corpora, including the high prevalence of duplicate, synthetic, and low-quality content, personally identifiable information, toxic language, and benchmark contamination. For instance, we find that about 50% of the documents in RedPajama and LAION-2B-en are duplicates. In addition, several datasets used for benchmarking models trained on such corpora are contaminated with respect to important benchmarks, including the Winograd Schema Challenge and parts of GLUE and SuperGLUE. We open-source WIMBD\u2019s code and artifacts to provide a standard set of evaluations for new text-based corpora and to encourage more analyses and transparency around them.",

        "abstract": "Generative pre-trained models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in language and vision domains by learning useful representations. In this paper, we extend the scope of this effectiveness by showing that visual robot manipulation can significantly benefit from large-scale video generative pre-training. We introduce GR-1, a GPT-style model designed for multi-task language-conditioned visual robot manipulation. GR-1 takes as inputs a language instruction, a sequence of observation images, and a sequence of robot states. It predicts robot actions as well as future images in an end-to-end manner. Thanks to a flexible design, GR-1 can be seamlessly finetuned on robot data after pre-trained on a large-scale video dataset. We perform extensive experiments on the challenging CALVIN benchmark and a real robot. On CALVIN benchmark, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods and improves the success rate from 88.9% to 94.9%. In the setting of zero-shot unseen scene generalization, GR-1 improves the success rate from 53.3% to 85.4%. In real robot experiments, GR-1 also outperforms baseline methods and shows strong potentials in generalization to unseen scenes and objects. We provide inaugural evidence that a unified GPT-style transformer, augmented with large-scale video generative pre-training, exhibits remarkable generalization to multi-task visual robot manipulation.

The authors propose a novel approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases using microencapsulated stem cells, which has garnered substantial attention in recent times.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nThe authors describe the use of microencapsulation technology to encapsulate stem cells in a biocompatible matrix, which is then implanted into the target area of the brain. The encapsulated stem cells are designed to release a cocktail of growth factors and signaling molecules that promote neural repair and regeneration. The authors report the use of a combination of in vitro and in vivo studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the microencapsulated stem cells.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results of the study show promising promise, with significant improvements in motor function and neural regeneration observed in the treated groups. The authors also report a reduction in inflammatory markers and oxidative stress in the treated groups, which is consistent with the expected effects of stem cell therapy.\n\nHowever, the results are somewhat limited, as the study only included a small number of subjects (n=10) and a short duration of treatment (12 weeks). Furthermore, the authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the potential risks and side effects associated with the microencapsulated stem cells.\n\n**Discussion**\n\nThe discussion section of the paper provides a good overview of the potential mechanisms of action of the microencapsulated stem cells, including the release of growth factors and signaling molecules that promote neural repair and regeneration. However, the authors could have provided more insight into the potential limitations and challenges associated with the use of microencapsulated stem cells in treating neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nOverall, the paper presents an innovative approach to treating neurodegenerative diseases using microencapsulated stem cells.

        "abstract": "High accuracy, low latency and high energy efficiency represent a set of conflicting goals when searching for system solutions for image classification and detection. While high-quality images naturally result in more precise detection and classification, they also result in a heavier computational workload for imaging and processing, reduced camera frame rates, and increased data communication between the camera and processor. Taking inspiration from the foveal-peripheral sampling mechanism, and saccade mechanism of the human visual system and the filling-in phenomena of brain, we have developed an active scene reconstruction architecture based on multiple foveal views. This model stitches together information from a sequence of foveal-peripheral views, which are sampled from multiple glances. Assisted by a reinforcement learning-based saccade mechanism, our model reduces the required input pixels by over 90% per frame while maintaining the same level of performance in image recognition as with the original images. We evaluated the effectiveness of our model using the GTSRB dataset and the ImageNet dataset. Using an equal number of input pixels, our model demonstrates a 5% higher image recognition accuracy compared to state-of-theart foveal-peripheral based vision systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our foveal sampling/saccadic scene reconstruction model exhibits significantly lower complexity and higher data efficiency during the training phase compared to existing approaches.

Calibration measures quantify the degree of miscalibration, and reliability diagrams visualize the structure of this miscalibration. However, the most common constructions of reliability diagrams and calibration measures \u2014 binning and ECE \u2014 both suffer from well-known flaws (e.g. discontinuity). We show that a simple modification fixes both constructions: first smooth the observations using an RBF kernel, then compute the Expected Calibration Error (ECE) of this smoothed function. We prove that with a careful choice of bandwidth, this method yields a calibration measure that is well-behaved in the sense of B\u0142asiok, Gopalan, Hu, and Nakkiran (2023) \u2014 a consistent calibration measure. We call this measure the SmoothECE. Moreover, the reliability diagram obtained from this smoothed function visually encodes the SmoothECE, just as binned reliability diagrams encode the BinnedECE.

        "abstract": "We seek to uncover the latent interest units from behavioral data to better learn user preferences under the VAE framework. Existing practices tend to ignore the multiple facets of item characteristics, which may not capture it at appropriate granularity. Moreover, current studies equate the granularity of item space to that of user interests, which we postulate is not ideal as user interests would likely map to a small subset of item space. In addition, the compositionality of user interests has received inadequate attention, preventing the modeling of interactions between explanatory factors driving a user\u2019s decision. To resolve this, we propose to align user interests with multi-faceted item characteristics. First, we involve prototype-based representation learning to discover item characteristics along multiple facets. Second, we compose user interests from uncovered item characteristics via binding mechanism, separating the granularity of user preferences from that of item space. Third, we design a dedicated bi-directional binding block, aiding the derivation of compositional user interests. On real-world datasets, the experimental results demonstrate the strong performance of our proposed method compared to a series of baselines.",

        "abstract": "The transferability of deep neural networks (DNNs) has made significant progress in image and language processing. However, due to the heterogeneity among tables, such DNN bonus is still far from being well exploited on tabular data prediction (e.g., regression or classification tasks). Condensing knowledge from diverse domains, language models (LMs) possess the capability to comprehend feature names from various tables, potentially serving as versatile learners in transferring knowledge across distinct tables and diverse prediction tasks, but their discrete text representation space is inherently incompatible with numerical feature values in tables. In this paper, we present TP-BERTa, a specifically pre-trained LM for tabular data prediction. Concretely, a novel relative magnitude tokenization converts scalar numerical feature values to finely discrete, high-dimensional tokens, and an intra-feature attention approach integrates feature values with the corresponding feature names. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our pre-trained TP-BERTa leads the performance among tabular DNNs and is competitive with Gradient Boosted Decision Tree models in typical tabular data regime.",

        "abstract": "Distributed optimization (DO) approaches for saddle point problems (SPP) have recently gained in popularity due to the critical role they play in machine learning (ML). Existing works mostly target smooth unconstrained objectives in Euclidean space, whereas ML problems often involve constraints or non-smooth regularization, which results in a need for composite optimization. Moreover, although non-smooth regularization often serves to induce structure (e.g., sparsity), standard aggregation schemes in distributed optimization break this structure. Addressing these issues, we propose Federated Dual Extrapolation (FeDualEx), an extra-step primal-dual algorithm with local updates, which is the first of its kind to encompass both saddle point optimization and composite objectives under the distributed paradigm. Using a generalized notion of Bregman divergence, we analyze its convergence and communication complexity in the homogeneous setting. Furthermore, the empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of FeDualEx for inducing structure in these challenging settings.",

The effects of meditation on stress reduction in college students have been investigated in numerous studies, but the evidence is not yet conclusive. This systematic review aims to provide an overview of the current evidence on the effects of meditation on stress reduction in college students.\n\nMethods: A systematic search of electronic databases was conducted using the Cochrane Collaboration's risk of bias tool to evaluate the quality of the included studies. Studies were included if they investigated the effects of meditation on stress reduction in college students, published between 2010 and 2020, and had a sample size of 10 or more participants. The studies were categorized into three groups based on their study designs: (1) randomized controlled trials (RCTs), (2) quasi-experimental studies, and (3) non-experimental studies.\n\nResults: A total of 14 studies were included in the review. The majority of the studies were RCTs, which were the most effective in reducing stress in college students.

While unorthodox, fine-tuning large language models on text-encoded atomistic data is simple to implement yet reliable, with around 90% of sampled structures obeying physical constraints on atom positions and charges. Using energy above hull calculations from both learned ML potentials and gold-standard DFT calculations, we show that our strongest model (fine-tuned LLaMA-2 70B) can generate materials predicted to be metastable at about twice the rate (49% vs 28%) of CDVAE, a competing diffusion model. Because of text prompting\u2019s inherent flexibility, our models can simultaneously be used for unconditional generation of stable material, infilling of partial structures and text-conditional generation. Finally, we show that language models\u2019 ability to capture key symmetries of crystal structures improves with model scale, suggesting that the biases of pretrained LLMs are surprisingly well-suited for atomistic data.",

The vaccine candidate consists of a plasmid construct containing the influenza A (H1N1) gene sequence. We used a mouse model to evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate and found that it induced a strong immune response. The results of this study suggest that the mRNA-based influenza vaccine candidate is a promising approach for the prevention of influenza.\n\n**Introduction:** \nInfluenza is a highly contagious and deadly viral disease that affects humans and animals. The influenza virus has a high mutation rate and can cause pandemics. Traditional influenza vaccines are produced using inactivated or attenuated virus. However, these methods have limitations and can be time-consuming. The use of mRNA technology has emerged as a promising alternative for the production of influenza vaccines.\n\n**Methods:** \nWe used a mouse model to evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate. We first isolated the influenza A (H1N1) gene sequence from a clinical sample and inserted it into a plasmid construct. We then transfected the plasmid construct into mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) using lipofectamine. We incubated the MEFs for 24-48 hours and then harvested the supernatant. We used ELISA (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay) to measure the immune response.\n\n**Results:** \nThe results of the ELISA assay showed a strong immune response against the influenza A (H1N1) gene sequence. The titers of IgG and IgM were higher than those of the control group. The results of the mouse model study showed that the vaccine candidate induced a strong immune response and protected against challenge with the influenza A (H1N1) virus.\n\n**Discussion:** \nThe results of this study suggest that the mRNA-based influenza vaccine candidate is a promising approach for the prevention of influenza. The use of mRNA technology offers several advantages over traditional methods of vaccine production. These include faster production times and reduced production costs. The use of mRNA-based vaccines also offers the potential for more flexible and adaptable vaccine formulations.\n\n**Conclusion:** \nIn this study, we demonstrated the potential of mRNA-based influenza vaccines. The vaccine candidate induced a strong immune response and protected against challenge with the influenza A (H1N1) virus. The results of this study suggest that mRNA-based influenza vaccines are a promising approach for the prevention of influenza.\n\n**Peer Review**\n\n**Strengths:** \n1. The study demonstrates the potential of mRNA-based influenza vaccines.\n2. The use of a mouse model to evaluate the immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate is a good approach.\n3. The study highlights the advantages of mRNA-based vaccines over traditional methods.\n\n**Weaknesses:** \n1. The study only used a mouse model and did not include human clinical trials.\n2. The study did not evaluate the safety and efficacy of the vaccine candidate in humans.\n3. The study only evaluated the immunogenicity of the vaccine candidate and did not evaluate its protective efficacy against influenza.\n\n**Suggestions for improvement:** \n1. Conduct human clinical trials to evaluate the safety and efficacy of the vaccine candidate.\n2. Evaluate the protective efficacy of the vaccine candidate against influenza in humans.\n3. Conduct a larger-scale study to evaluate the immunogenicity and protective efficacy of the vaccine candidate in a more diverse population.\n4. Consider the potential for immune responses to be influenced by factors such as age and pre-exposure to influenza.\n\n**Recommendation:** \nBased on the results of this study, I recommend that the vaccine candidate be further developed and tested in human clinical trials. The study highlights the potential of mRNA-based influenza vaccines and demonstrates the need for further research to fully evaluate their safety and efficacy.\n\n**Rating:** \nI would rate this study as a good effort and a promising approach to the prevention of influenza. However, further research is needed to fully evaluate the safety and efficacy of the vaccine candidate.\n\n**Future Directions:** \n1.

        "abstract": "In this paper, we present a novel defense against backdoor attacks on deep neural networks (DNNs), wherein adversaries covertly implant malicious behaviors (backdoors) into DNNs. Our defense falls within the category of post-development defenses that operate independently of how the model was generated. Our proposed defense is built upon an intriguing concept: given a backdoored model, we reverse engineer it to directly extract its backdoor functionality to a backdoor expert model. To accomplish this, we finetune the backdoored model over a small set of intentionally mislabeled clean samples, such that it unlearns the normal functionality while still preserving the backdoor functionality, and thus resulting in a model (dubbed a backdoor expert model) that can only recognize backdoor inputs. Based on the extracted backdoor expert model, we show the feasibility of devising robust backdoor input detectors that filter out the backdoor inputs during model inference. Further augmented by an ensemble strategy with a finetuned auxiliary model, our defense, BaDExpert (Backdoor Input Detection with Backdoor Expert), effectively mitigates 17 SOTA backdoor attacks while minimally impacting clean utility. The effectiveness of BaDExpert has been verified on multiple datasets (CIFAR10, GTSRB, and ImageNet) across multiple model architectures (ResNet, VGG, MobileNetV2, and Vision Transformer).

        "abstract": "Inspired by the outstanding zero-shot capability of vision language models (VLMs) in image classification tasks, open-vocabulary object detection has attracted increasing interest by distilling the broad VLM knowledge into detector training. However, most existing open-vocabulary detectors learn by aligning region embeddings with categorical labels (e.g., bicycle) only, disregarding the capability of VLMs on aligning visual embeddings with fine-grained text description of object parts (e.g., pedals and bells). This paper presents DVDet, a Descriptor-Enhanced Open Vocabulary Detector that introduces conditional context prompts and hierarchical textual descriptors that enable precise region-text alignment as well as open-vocabulary detection training in general. Specifically, the conditional context prompt transforms regional embeddings into image-like representations that can be directly integrated into general open vocabulary detection training. In addition, we introduce large language models as an interactive and implicit knowledge repository which enables iterative mining and refining visually oriented textual descriptors for precise region-text alignment. Extensive experiments over multiple large-scale benchmarks show that DVDet outperforms the state-of-the-art consistently by large margins.",

We analyzed the growth and development of rosemary plants under three different temperature regimes: 15\u00b0C/10\u00b0C night/day cycle (cool), 20\u00b0C/15\u00b0C night/day cycle (moderate), and 25\u00b0C/20\u00b0C night/day cycle (warm). Our results show that the cool temperature regime resulted in higher yields and improved chemical composition of rosemary leaves compared to the moderate and warm temperature regimes. We also found that the cool temperature regime led to an increase in the production of camphor and borneol.\n\n**Introduction:**\nRosemary (Rosmarinus officinalis) is a popular herb used for its medicinal and culinary purposes. Its growth and development are influenced by environmental factors such as temperature. Greenhouse cultivation is a common method for growing rosemary due to its controlled environment. However, the effects of different temperature regimes on rosemary cultivation have not been fully investigated.\n\n**Materials and Methods:**\nWe used 120 rosemary plants (Rosmarinus officinalis) and grew them under three different temperature regimes: 15\u00b0C/10\u00b0C night/day cycle (cool), 20\u00b0C/15\u00b0C night/day cycle (moderate), and 25\u00b0C/20\u00b0C night/day cycle (warm) for 12 weeks. The plants were watered and fertilized regularly. We measured the growth and development of rosemary plants using the following parameters: plant height (PH), leaf area (LA), and leaf dry weight (LDW).\n\n**Results:**\nWe analyzed the growth and development of rosemary plants under the three different temperature regimes. Our results show that the cool temperature regime resulted in higher yields and improved chemical composition of rosemary leaves compared to the moderate and warm temperature regimes. We also found that the cool temperature regime led to an increase in the production of camphor and borneol.\n\n**Discussion:**\nWe discuss the results of our study and the possible reasons behind the observed effects of different temperature regimes on rosemary cultivation. Our results suggest that the cool temperature regime is beneficial for rosemary cultivation. We also discuss the potential applications of our findings.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrates the effects of different temperature regimes on the yield and chemical composition of rosemary cultivated under greenhouse conditions. Our results suggest that the cool temperature regime is beneficial for rosemary cultivation.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. The study has a clear and well-defined objective.\n2. The authors have used a well-established method for measuring growth and development parameters.\n3. The study has a relatively small sample size.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. The study has a relatively small sample size (n=120).\n2. The authors have not controlled for other environmental factors that may affect rosemary cultivation.\n3. The study has a limited scope and does not explore the effects of other environmental factors on rosemary cultivation.\n4. The authors have not discussed the potential limitations of their study.\n5. The study has not been replicated or validated by other researchers.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. The authors should increase the sample size to improve the generalizability of their results.\n2. The authors should control for other environmental factors that may affect rosemary cultivation.\n3. The authors should explore the effects of other environmental factors on rosemary cultivation.\n4. The authors should discuss the potential limitations of their study.\n5. The authors should replicate or validate their study using other researchers.\n\n**Future Directions:**\n\n1. Investigate the effects of other environmental factors on rosemary cultivation.\n2. Explore the effects of different fertilization regimes on rosemary cultivation.\n3. Investigate the effects of different pruning regimes on rosemary cultivation.\n\n**Overall Evaluation:**\n\nThis study provides some interesting results on the effects of different temperature regimes on rosemary cultivation. However, the study has several limitations and should be improved before it can be considered a high-quality study. The authors should address the limitations and provide a clear discussion of the potential applications of their findings.\n\n**Rating:** 6/10\n\n**Recommendation:** Resubmission for revision.",

        "title": "PARETO DEEP LONG-TAILED RECOGNITION: A CONFLICT-AVERSE SOLUTION",
        "abstract": "Deep long-tailed recognition (DLTR) has attracted much attention due to its close touch with realistic scenarios. Recent advances have focused on re-balancing across various aspects, e.g., sampling strategy, loss re-weighting, logit adjustment, and input/parameter perturbation, etc. However, few studies have considered dynamic re-balancing to address intrinsic optimization conflicts, which are identified as prevalent and critical issues in this study. In this paper, we empirically establish the severity of the optimization conflict issue in the DLTR scenario, which leads to a degradation of representation learning. This observation serves as the motivation for pursuing Pareto optimal solutions. Unfortunately, a straightforward integration of multi-objective optimization (MOO) with DLTR methods is infeasible due to the disparity between multi-task learning (MTL) and DLTR. Therefore, we propose effective alternatives by decoupling MOO-based MTL from a temporal perspective rather than a structural one. Furthermore, we enhance the integration of MOO and DLTR by investigating the generalization and convergence problems. Specifically, we propose optimizing the variability collapse loss, guided by the derived MOObased DLTR generalization bound, to improve generalization. Additionally, we anticipate worst-case optimization to ensure convergence. Building upon the proposed MOO framework, we introduce a novel method called Pareto deep LOngTailed recognition (PLOT). Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method not only generally improves mainstream pipelines, but also achieves an augmented version to realize state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

        "title": "RAIN: YOUR LANGUAGE MODELS CAN ALIGN THEMSELVES",
        "abstract": "Large language models (LLMs) often demonstrate inconsistencies with human preferences. Previous research typically gathered human preference data and then aligned the pre-trained models using reinforcement learning or instruction tuning, a.k.a. the finetuning step. In contrast, aligning frozen LLMs without requiring alignment data is more appealing. This work explores the potential of the latter setting. We discover that by integrating self-evaluation and rewind mechanisms, unaligned LLMs can directly produce responses consistent with human preferences via self-boosting. We introduce a novel inference method, Rewindable Auto-regressive INference (RAIN), that allows pre-trained LLMs to evaluate their own generation and use the evaluation results to guide rewind and generation for AI safety. Notably, RAIN operates without the need of extra data for model alignment and abstains from any training, gradient computation, or parameter updates. Experimental results evaluated by GPT-4 and humans demonstrate the effectiveness of RAIN: on the HH dataset, RAIN improves the harmlessness rate of LLaMA 30B from 82% of vanilla inference to 97%, while maintaining the helpfulness rate. On the TruthfulQA dataset, RAIN improves the truthfulness of the already-well-aligned LLaMA-2-chat 13B model by 5%. The code is available at https://github.com/SafeAILab/RAIN.",

While some aspects of the study are impressive, there are also several areas that need improvement. I will provide a detailed review of the paper, highlighting both its strengths and weaknesses.\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Clear Objective**: The paper clearly states its objective, which is to explore non-invasive methods for predicting human health outcomes. This objective is concise, well-defined, and aligns with the journal's scope.\n2. **Literature Review**: The authors provide a comprehensive literature review, highlighting recent advances in non-invasive health monitoring and prediction. This review is well-organized, and the authors provide relevant examples and case studies.\n3. **Experimental Design**: The experimental design is well-structured, and the authors use a combination of data-driven and model-based approaches.

They also discuss potential applications and implications of their results.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. **Limited Sample Size**: One of the major concerns is that the sample size is relatively small, which may limit the generalizability of the results. A larger sample size would have strengthened the study.\n2. **Lack of Control Group**: Another limitation is that there is no control group in some of the experiments. This makes it difficult to determine whether any observed effects are due to non-invasive health monitoring or other factors.\n3. **Insufficient Validation**: While the authors provide some validation results, they are limited in scope. Additional validation studies would have strengthened the paper's overall impact.\n4. **Overemphasis on Single Method**: Some of the results suggest that a single non-invasive method, such as wearable sensors, may have superior performance. However, this overemphasis may overlook other potential non-invasive methods that could also have promise.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n1. **Increased Sample Size**: I recommend increasing the sample size in future studies to improve generalizability and robustness.\n2. **Control Group**: Including a control group in future experiments would help determine whether observed effects are specific to non-invasive health monitoring.\n3. **Additional Validation**: Conducting additional validation studies would strengthen the paper's overall impact and provide a clearer picture of non-invasive health monitoring's potential.\n4. **Multi-Method Approach**: Considering a multi-method approach, incorporating multiple non-invasive health monitoring modalities, would provide a more comprehensive evaluation of their potential.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, \"Exploring Non-Invasive Methods for Predicting Human Health Outcomes\" is a solid study that explores various non-invasive health monitoring approaches. While there are some weaknesses, particularly related to sample size, control groups, and validation, these can be addressed in future studies. With a larger sample size, additional validation, and a multi-method approach, this study has significant potential for advancing our understanding of non-invasive health monitoring and prediction.\n\n**Conflict of Interest Statement:**\nThe author declares no conflict of interest.\n\n**Acknowledgments:**\nThe author acknowledges support from various funding agencies and institutions, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (DARPA).\n\n**References:**\nThe authors provide a comprehensive list of referenced studies, including recent publications in top-tier journals.\n\n**Reviewer's Contact Information:**\nDr. Jane Doe\nResearch Scientist\nJohns Hopkins University\njane.doe@jhu.edu\n\nNote: This is a sample peer review.

In this paper, we investigate the problem of adversarial attacks on fairness of GNNs and propose G-FairAttack, a general framework for attacking various types of fairness-aware GNNs in terms of fairness with an unnoticeable effect on prediction utility. In addition, we propose a fast computation technique to reduce the time complexity of G-FairAttack. The experimental study demonstrates that G-FairAttack successfully corrupts the fairness of different types of GNNs while keeping the attack unnoticeable. Our study on fairness attacks sheds light on potential vulnerabilities in fairness-aware GNNs and guides further research on the robustness of GNNs in terms of fairness.",

        "abstract": "Recently, diffusion models have achieved remarkable success in generating tasks, including image and audio generation. However, like other generative models, diffusion models are prone to privacy issues. In this paper, we propose an efficient query-based membership inference attack (MIA), namely Proximal Initialization Attack (PIA), which utilizes groundtruth trajectory obtained by \u03b5 initialized in t = 0 and predicted point to infer memberships. Experimental results indicate that the proposed method can achieve competitive performance with only two queries that achieve at least 6\u00d7 efficiency than the previous SOTA baseline on both discrete-time and continuous-time diffusion models. Moreover, previous works on the privacy of diffusion models have focused on vision tasks without considering audio tasks. Therefore, we also explore the robustness of diffusion models to MIA in the text-tospeech (TTS) task, which is an audio generation task. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to study the robustness of diffusion models to MIA in the TTS task. Experimental results indicate that models with mel-spectrogram (image-like) output are vulnerable to MIA, while models with audio output are relatively robust to MIA.

        "abstract": "The current face recognition (FR) algorithms has achieved a high level of accuracy, making further improvements increasingly challenging. While existing FR algorithms primarily focus on optimizing margins and loss functions, limited attention has been given to exploring the feature representation space. Therefore, this paper endeavors to improve FR performance in the view of feature representation space. Firstly, we consider two FR models that exhibit distinct performance discrepancies, where one model exhibits superior recognition accuracy compared to the other. We implement orthogonal decomposition on the features from the superior model along those from the inferior model and obtain two sub-features. Surprisingly, we find the sub-feature orthogonal to the inferior still possesses a certain level of face distinguishability. We adjust the modulus of the sub-features and recombine them through vector addition. Experiments demonstrate this recombination is likely to contribute to an improved facial feature representation, even better than features from the original superior model. Motivated by this discovery, we further consider how to improve FR accuracy when there is only one FR model available. Inspired by knowledge distillation, we incorporate the intraclass incoherence constraint (IIC) to solve the problem. Experiments on various FR benchmarks show the existing state-of-the-art method with IIC can be further improved, highlighting its potential to further enhance FR performance.",

This study examines the impact of rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns on the distribution and abundance of terrestrial ecosystems. We used a meta-analysis of 20 studies to investigate the effects of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems. Our results show that climate change is likely to alter the distribution and abundance of terrestrial ecosystems, with changes in temperature and precipitation patterns leading to shifts in species composition and ecosystem function.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n**Overall Impression:**\nThis paper provides a comprehensive review of the current state of knowledge on the effects of climate change on terrestrial ecosystems.

The authors have not explicitly addressed the potential confounding variables that could influence the results, such as changes in soil moisture or vegetation cover.\n3. The study's conclusions are based on a relatively small sample size of 20 studies, which may not be representative of the full range of terrestrial ecosystems.\n4. The authors have not provided a clear explanation of the methods used to analyze the data, including the specific statistical tests and models used.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n1.

        "abstract": "Graph transformers (GTs) have emerged as a promising architecture that is theoretically more expressive than message-passing graph neural networks (GNNs). However, typical GT models have at least quadratic complexity and thus cannot scale to large graphs. While there are several linear GTs recently proposed, they still lag behind GNN counterparts on several popular graph datasets, which poses a critical concern on their practical expressivity. To balance the trade-off between expressivity and scalability of GTs, we propose Polynormer, a polynomialexpressive GT model with linear complexity. Polynormer is built upon a novel base model that learns a high-degree polynomial on input features. To enable the base model permutation equivariant, we integrate it with graph topology and node features separately, resulting in local and global equivariant attention models. Consequently, Polynormer adopts a linear local-to-global attention scheme to learn high-degree equivariant polynomials whose coefficients are controlled by attention scores. Polynormer has been evaluated on 13 homophilic and heterophilic datasets, including large graphs with millions of nodes. Our extensive experiment results show that Polynormer outperforms state-of-the-art GNN and GT baselines on most datasets, even without the use of nonlinear activation functions.

        "abstract": "3D visual grounding is the ability to localize objects in 3D scenes conditioned by utterances. Most existing methods devote the referring head to localize the referred object directly, causing failure in complex scenarios. In addition, it does not illustrate how and why the network reaches the final decision. In this paper, we address this question \u201cCan we design an interpretable 3D visual grounding framework that has the potential to mimic the human perception system?\u201d. To this end, we formulate the 3D visual grounding problem as a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) task by first predicting a chain of anchors and then the final target. Interpretability not only improves the overall performance but also helps us identify failure cases. Following the chain of thoughts approach enables us to decompose the referring task into interpretable intermediate steps, boosting the performance and making our framework extremely data-efficient. Moreover, our proposed framework can be easily integrated into any existing architecture. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on the Nr3D, Sr3D, and Scanrefer benchmarks and show consistent performance gains compared to existing methods without requiring manually annotated data. Furthermore, our proposed framework, dubbed CoT3DRef, is significantly data-efficient, whereas on the Sr3D dataset, when trained only on 10% of the data, we match the SOTA performance that trained on the entire data.

        "abstract": "In Causal Bayesian Optimization (CBO), an agent intervenes on a structural causal model with known graph but unknown mechanisms to maximize a downstream reward variable. In this paper, we consider the generalization where other agents or external events also intervene on the system, which is key for enabling adaptiveness to non-stationarities such as weather changes, market forces, or adversaries. We formalize this generalization of CBO as Adversarial Causal Bayesian Optimization (ACBO) and introduce the first algorithm for ACBO with bounded regret: Causal Bayesian Optimization with Multiplicative Weights (CBO-MW). Our approach combines a classical online learning strategy with causal modeling of the rewards. To achieve this, it computes optimistic counterfactual reward estimates by propagating uncertainty through the causal graph. We derive regret bounds for CBO-MW that naturally depend on graph-related quantities. We further propose a scalable implementation for the case of combinatorial interventions and submodular rewards. Empirically, CBO-MW outperforms non-causal and non-adversarial Bayesian optimization methods on synthetic environments and environments based on real-word data. Our experiments include a realistic demonstration of how CBO-MW can be used to learn users\u2019 demand patterns in a shared mobility system and reposition vehicles in strategic areas.",

Our approach utilizes a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn complex patterns in protein-ligand interactions. We validate our approach using a dataset of protein-ligand complexes and achieve a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.33 kcal/mol. Our results show that our approach outperforms traditional machine learning methods and provides a robust prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nProtein-ligand binding affinity is a critical parameter in understanding protein function and ligand design. Current methods for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity rely on traditional machine learning techniques such as support vector machines (SVMs) and gradient boosting machines (GBMs). However, these methods have limitations in capturing complex patterns in protein-ligand interactions. To address this challenge, we propose a novel deep learning approach that leverages the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to learn complex patterns in protein-ligand interactions.\n\n**Methods:**\n\nWe used a dataset of protein-ligand complexes to train and validate our approach. Our dataset consists of 1000 protein-ligand complexes with binding affinity labels. We preprocessed the data by normalizing the binding affinity values and removing any outliers. We trained our approach using a combination of CNNs and RNNs. Our CNNs are designed to learn local patterns in protein-ligand interactions, while our RNNs are designed to learn long-range patterns. We used a combination of convolutional and recurrent layers to capture both local and long-range patterns.\n\n**Results:**\n\nWe evaluated our approach using a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.33 kcal/mol. Our results show that our approach outperforms traditional machine learning methods and provides a robust prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity. We compared our approach to a traditional machine learning approach using SVMs and GBMs. Our results show that our approach outperforms both SVMs and GBMs in terms of MAE.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, our novel approach using deep learning techniques provides a robust prediction of protein-ligand binding affinity. Our approach outperforms traditional machine learning methods and provides a significant improvement over current methods.

The MAmmoTH models are trained on MathInstruct, our meticulously curated instruction tuning dataset. MathInstruct is compiled from 13 math datasets with intermediate rationales, six of which have rationales newly curated by us. It presents a unique hybrid of chain-of-thought (CoT) and program-of-thought (PoT) rationales, and also ensures extensive coverage of diverse fields in math. The hybrid of CoT and PoT not only unleashes the potential of tool use but also allows different thought processes for different math problems. As a result, the MAmmoTH series substantially outperform existing open-source models on nine mathematical reasoning datasets across all scales with an average accuracy gain between 16% and 32%. Remarkably, our MAmmoTH-7B model reaches 33% on MATH (a competition-level dataset), which exceeds the best open-source 7B model (WizardMath) by 23%, and the MAmmoTH-34B model achieves 44% accuracy on MATH, even surpassing GPT4\u2019s CoT result.

        "abstract": "Reinforcement Learning with Human Feedback (RLHF) is the most prominent method for Language Model (LM) alignment. However, RLHF is an unstable and data-hungry process that continually requires new high-quality LM-generated data for finetuning. We introduce Advantage-Leftover Lunch RL (A-LOL), a new class of offline policy gradient algorithms that enable RL training on any pre-existing data. By assuming the entire LM output sequence as a single action, A-LOL allows incorporating sequence-level classifiers or human-designed scoring functions as rewards. Subsequently, by using LM\u2019s value estimate, A-LOL only trains on positive advantage (leftover) data points, making it resilient to noise. Overall, A-LOL is an easy-to-implement, sample-efficient, and stable LM training recipe. We demonstrate the effectiveness of A-LOL and its variants with a set of four different language generation tasks. We compare against both online RL (PPO) and recent preference-based (DPO, PRO) and reward-based (GOLD) offline RL baselines. On the commonly-used RLHF benchmark, Helpful and Harmless Assistant (HHA), LMs trained with A-LOL methods achieve the highest diversity while also being rated more safe and helpful than the baselines according to humans. Additionally, in the remaining three tasks, A-LOL could optimize multiple distinct reward functions even when using noisy or suboptimal training data.",

This systematic review and meta-analysis aim to synthesize existing literature on the effects of climate-induced water stress on crop yields and food security in SSA. A total of 37 studies were identified through a comprehensive literature search. The results show that climate-induced water stress significantly affects crop yields and food security in SSA. The meta-analysis revealed that a 10% decrease in water availability leads to a 3.5% decrease in crop yields. Additionally, the study found that the impact of climate-induced water stress on food security is more pronounced in rural areas. The study's findings highlight the need for sustainable water resource management practices and climate-resilient agriculture in SSA. The study's limitations and future directions are also discussed.\n\nBackground:\nClimate-induced water stress is a growing concern in SSA due to the increasing trend of droughts and water scarcity. The region's agriculture is highly vulnerable to climate change due to the reliance on rain-fed agriculture and limited water resources. Climate-induced water stress affects not only crop yields but also food security. The impact of climate-induced water stress on food security is more pronounced in rural areas due to the limited access to water and other resources. The effects of climate-induced water stress on crop yields and food security in SSA are complex and multifaceted. This systematic review aims to provide an overview of the existing literature on the effects of climate-induced water stress on crop yields and food security in SSA.\n\nMethod:\nA comprehensive literature search was conducted through major databases and academic journals. The inclusion criterion was studies that investigated the effects of climate-induced water stress on crop yields and food security in SSA. The exclusion criterion was studies that did not focus on SSA or did not investigate the effects of climate-induced water stress on crop yields and food security. A total of 37 studies were identified through the literature search. The studies were then screened and selected based on the inclusion and exclusion criteria. The selected studies were then analyzed and synthesized into a meta-analysis. The meta-analysis was conducted using the Review Manager software (version 5.4).\n\nResults:\nThe results of the systematic review and meta-analysis show that climate-induced water stress significantly affects crop yields and food security in SSA. The meta-analysis revealed that a 10% decrease in water availability leads to a 3.5% decrease in crop yields. The study also found that the impact of climate-induced water stress on food security is more pronounced in rural areas. The results of the systematic review and meta-analysis highlight the need for sustainable water resource management practices and climate-resilient agriculture in SSA. The study's findings also suggest that the impact of climate-induced water stress on crop yields and food security in SSA is more pronounced during the dry season.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe study's findings highlight the need for sustainable water resource management practices and climate-resilient agriculture in SSA. The study's results also suggest that the impact of climate-induced water stress on crop yields and food security in SSA is more pronounced during the dry season. The study's limitations and future directions are also discussed. The study's limitations include the limited sample size and the potential bias in the literature review. The study's future directions include conducting further research on the effects of climate-induced water stress on crop yields and food security in SSA and exploring the potential of climate-resilient agriculture in SSA.\n\nConclusion:\nThe study's findings highlight the need for sustainable water resource management practices and climate-resilient agriculture in SSA. The study's results suggest that the impact of climate-induced water stress on crop yields and food security in SSA is more pronounced during the dry season. The study's limitations and future directions are also discussed. The study's results provide valuable insights into the effects of climate-induced water stress on crop yields and food security in SSA and highlight the need for further research and policy interventions in SSA.\n\nPeer Review:\n\nThe paper \"Understanding the Effects of Climate-Induced Water Stress on Crop Yields and Food Security in Sub-Saharan Africa: A Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis\" is a well-structured and well-written paper that provides a comprehensive overview of the effects of climate-induced water stress on crop yields and food security in Sub-Saharan Africa. The paper's systematic review and meta-analysis methodology is sound and well-explained.

We find real-world software engineering to be a rich, sustainable, and challenging testbed for evaluating the next generation of language models. To this end, we introduce SWE-bench, an evaluation framework consisting of 2,294 software engineering problems drawn from real GitHub issues and corresponding pull requests across 12 popular Python repositories. Given a codebase along with a description of an issue to be resolved, a language model is tasked with editing the codebase to address the issue. Resolving issues in SWE-bench frequently requires understanding and coordinating changes across multiple functions, classes, and even files simultaneously, calling for models to interact with execution environments, process extremely long contexts and perform complex reasoning that goes far beyond traditional code generation tasks. Our evaluations show that both state-ofthe-art proprietary models and our fine-tuned model SWE-Llama can resolve only the simplest issues. The best-performing model, Claude 2, is able to solve a mere 1.96% of the issues. Advances on SWE-bench represent steps towards LMs that are more practical, intelligent, and autonomous.",

        "abstract": "Imagining the future trajectory is the key for robots to make sound planning and successfully reach their goals. Therefore, text-conditioned video prediction (TVP) is an essential task to facilitate general robot policy learning. To tackle this task and empower robots with the ability to foresee the future, we propose a sample and computation-efficient model, named Seer, by inflating the pretrained text-toimage (T2I) stable diffusion models along the temporal axis. We enhance the U-Net and language conditioning model by incorporating computation-efficient spatial-temporal attention. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Frame Sequential Text Decomposer module that dissects a sentence\u2019s global instruction into temporally aligned sub-instructions, ensuring precise integration into each frame of generation. Our framework allows us to effectively leverage the extensive prior knowledge embedded in pretrained T2I models across the frames. With the adaptable-designed architecture, Seer makes it possible to generate high-fidelity, coherent, and instruction-aligned video frames by fine-tuning a few layers on a small amount of data. The experimental results on Something Something V2 (SSv2), Bridgedata and EpicKitchens-100 datasets demonstrate our superior video prediction performance with around 480-GPU hours versus CogVideo with over 12,480-GPU hours: achieving the 31% FVD improvement compared to the current SOTA model on SSv2 and 83.7% average preference in the human evaluation.

The authors propose that CRISPR-Cas13 can be engineered to specifically bind to disease-associated RNAs, leading to their degradation and subsequent reduction in disease progression. The authors demonstrate in vitro and in vivo studies using a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, showing promising results with minimal side effects.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Overall Impression:** The paper presents a novel and intriguing approach to treating neurodegenerative disorders using CRISPR-Cas13. The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the underlying mechanisms and provide robust in vitro and in vivo studies to support their claims.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. **Novel Approach:** The use of CRISPR-Cas13 as a therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative disorders is novel and has significant potential. The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the underlying mechanisms and provide a compelling rationale for their approach.\n2. **Robust In Vitro Studies:** The in vitro studies demonstrate that CRISPR-Cas13 can specifically bind to disease-associated RNAs, leading to their degradation. These results are well-supported and provide a solid foundation for further studies.\n3. **In Vivo Studies:** The in vivo studies using a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease demonstrate promising results, with minimal side effects. These results are encouraging and suggest that CRISPR-Cas13 may be a viable therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative disorders.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Limited Sample Size:** The sample size for both in vitro and in vivo studies is limited. A larger sample size would provide more robust results and increase confidence in the findings.\n2. **Lack of Controls:** The in vitro studies lack controls, such as a non-targeting CRISPR-Cas13 treatment, to compare to. This makes it difficult to determine whether the observed effects are specific to CRISPR-Cas13 or can be attributed to other factors.\n3. **Off-Target Effects:** The authors do not discuss off-target effects, which is a critical consideration when using CRISPR-Cas13 as a therapeutic approach. It is essential to evaluate off-target effects to ensure that CRISPR-Cas13 does not have unintended consequences.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Increase Sample Size:** The authors should increase the sample size for both in vitro and in vivo studies to provide more robust results and increase confidence in the findings.\n2. **Incorporate Controls:** The authors should include controls, such as a non-targeting CRISPR-Cas13 treatment, to compare to in vitro studies.\n3. **Evaluate Off-Target Effects:** The authors should evaluate off-target effects to ensure that CRISPR-Cas13 does not have unintended consequences.\n\n**Conclusion:** Overall, this paper presents a novel and intriguing approach to treating neurodegenerative disorders using CRISPR-Cas13. While there are some limitations to the study, including limited sample size and lack of controls, the authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the underlying mechanisms and provide promising results. The authors should address these limitations in future studies to increase confidence in their findings.\n\n**Rating:** 8/10\n\n**Recommendation for Publication:** Yes, pending revisions addressing the limitations mentioned above.",

        "abstract": "The Segment Anything Model (SAM) stands as a foundational framework for image segmentation. While it exhibits remarkable zero-shot generalization in typical scenarios, its advantage diminishes when applied to specialized domains like medical imagery and remote sensing. To address this limitation, this paper introduces Conv-LoRA, a simple yet effective parameter-efficient fine-tuning approach. By integrating ultra-lightweight convolutional parameters into Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA), Conv-LoRA can inject image-related inductive biases into the plain ViT encoder, further reinforcing SAM\u2019s local prior assumption. Notably, Conv-LoRA not only preserves SAM\u2019s extensive segmentation knowledge but also revives its capacity of learning high-level image semantics, which is constrained by SAM\u2019s foreground-background segmentation pretraining. Comprehensive experimentation across diverse benchmarks spanning multiple domains underscores ConvLoRA\u2019s superiority in adapting SAM to real-world semantic segmentation tasks.1",

Traditional treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, have limitations in terms of efficacy and toxicity. Recent advances in nanotechnology and oncolytic viruses have led to the development of novel anti-cancer therapies.\n\n**Paper Objectives:**\nThe paper's objectives are to:\n\n* Develop a novel anti-cancer therapy using nanotechnology and oncolytic viruses\n* Evaluate the efficacy and safety of the therapy in a preclinical model\n* Investigate the mechanisms of oncolytic virus-mediated tumor regression\n\n**Paper Methodology:**\nThe authors used a combination of nanotechnology and oncolytic viruses to develop a novel anti-cancer therapy. They synthesized nanoparticles loaded with oncolytic viruses and administered them to mice with human lung cancer. The authors evaluated the efficacy and safety of the therapy using imaging and histological analysis.\n\n**Paper Results:**\nThe authors reported that the therapy was highly efficacious in inducing tumor regression in mice. The nanoparticles were well-tolerated, and no significant side effects were observed. The authors also reported that the oncolytic virus-mediated tumor regression was associated with increased expression of tumor suppressor genes.\n\n**Paper Discussion:**\nThe authors discussed the potential of the novel anti-cancer therapy in treating various types of cancer. They also highlighted the advantages of using nanotechnology and oncolytic viruses in cancer therapy.

The authors provide a thorough background and objectives, and the methodology is well-explained. The results are well-presented, and the discussion is thought-provoking.\n\nHowever, there are some concerns regarding the validity of the results. The sample size was small, and the study was conducted in a preclinical model. Therefore, it is unclear whether the results can be extrapolated to human patients.\n\nFurthermore, the authors did not provide sufficient information about the nanotechnology used in the study. The nanoparticles were synthesized using a proprietary method, and the authors did not disclose the exact composition of the nanoparticles.\n\nAdditionally, the authors did not address potential off-target effects of the oncolytic virus. While the authors reported that the virus was specific to tumor cells, it is unclear whether the virus could potentially affect other cell types.\n\nIn terms of the discussion, the authors could have provided more context about the current state of cancer therapy and the limitations of existing treatments. They could have also discussed the potential benefits and risks of the novel therapy in more detail.\n\nFinally, the authors could have provided more information about the long-term efficacy and safety of the therapy. While they reported that no significant side effects were observed, it is unclear whether the therapy would have long-term effects on the patient's overall health.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n* The authors should conduct a more extensive preclinical study to investigate the efficacy and safety of the therapy in a larger sample size and in a more diverse range of cancer models.\n* The authors should provide more information about the nanotechnology used in the study, including the exact composition of the nanoparticles.\n* The authors should address potential off-target effects of the oncolytic virus and provide more information about the specificity of the virus.\n* The authors should provide more context about the current state of cancer therapy and the limitations of existing treatments.\n* The authors should discuss the potential benefits and risks of the novel therapy in more detail.\n* The authors should provide more information about the long-term efficacy and safety of the therapy.\n\n**Rating:** 7/10\n\n**Recommendation for publication:** Yes, with revisions.\n\n**Editor's note:** The Editor-in-Chief would like to thank the reviewer for their thorough and constructive review.

        "abstract": "The most advanced text-to-image (T2I) models require significant training costs (e.g., millions of GPU hours), seriously hindering the fundamental innovation for the AIGC community while increasing CO2 emissions. This paper introduces PIXART-\u03b1, a Transformer-based T2I diffusion model whose image generation quality is competitive with state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Imagen, SDXL, and even Midjourney), reaching near-commercial application standards. Additionally, it supports high-resolution image synthesis up to 1024 \u00d7 1024 resolution with low training cost, as shown in Figure 1 and 2. To achieve this goal, three core designs are proposed: (1) Training strategy decomposition: We devise three distinct training steps that respectively optimize pixel dependency, textimage alignment, and image aesthetic quality; (2) Efficient T2I Transformer: We incorporate cross-attention modules into Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to inject text conditions and streamline the computation-intensive class-condition branch; (3) High-informative data: We emphasize the significance of concept density in text-image pairs and leverage a large Vision-Language model to auto-label dense pseudo-captions to assist text-image alignment learning. As a result, PIXART-\u03b1\u2019s training speed markedly surpasses existing large-scale T2I models, e.g., PIXART\u03b1 only takes 12% of Stable Diffusion v1.5\u2019s training time (\u223c753 vs. \u223c6,250 A100 GPU days), saving nearly $300,000 ($28,400 vs. $320,000) and reducing 90% CO2 emissions. Moreover, compared with a larger SOTA model, RAPHAEL, our training cost is merely 1%. Extensive experiments demonstrate that PIXART-\u03b1 excels in image quality, artistry, and semantic control. We hope PIXART-\u03b1 will provide new insights to the AIGC community and startups to accelerate building their own high-quality yet low-cost generative models from scratch.",

        "title": "ON DIFFERENTIALLY PRIVATE FEDERATED LINEAR CONTEXTUAL BANDITS",
        "abstract": "We consider cross-silo federated linear contextual bandit (LCB) problem under differential privacy, where multiple silos interact with their respective local users and communicate via a central server to realize collaboration without sacrificing each user\u2019s privacy. We identify three issues in the state-of-the-art (Dubey & Pentland, 2020): (i) failure of claimed privacy protection, (ii) incorrect regret bound due to noise miscalculation and (iii) ungrounded communication cost. To resolve these issues, we take a two-step approach. First, we design an algorithmic framework consisting of a generic federated LCB algorithm and flexible privacy protocols. Then, leveraging the proposed framework, we study federated LCBs under two different privacy constraints. We first establish privacy and regret guarantees under silo-level local differential privacy, which fix the issues present in state-of-the-art algorithm. To further improve the regret performance, we next consider shuffle model of differential privacy, under which we show that our algorithm can achieve nearly \u201coptimal\u201d regret without a trusted server. We accomplish this via two different schemes \u2013 one relies on a new result on privacy amplification via shuffling for DP mechanisms and another one leverages the integration of a shuffle protocol for vector sum into the tree-based mechanism, both of which might be of independent interest. Finally, we support our theoretical results with numerical evaluations over contextual bandit instances generated from both synthetic and real-life data.",

The approach aims to replace or repair damaged cells in the brain, thereby alleviating symptoms and slowing down the progression of the disease. The authors propose the use of a specific gene, which has been shown to have neuroprotective effects, and a type of stem cell that has the ability to differentiate into neurons. The approach is tested in a preclinical model of a common neurodegenerative disease, and the results show a significant improvement in symptoms and cognitive function.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. The authors have proposed a novel and innovative approach to treat neurodegenerative diseases, which is a significant advancement in the field.\n2. The use of a specific gene with neuroprotective effects and a type of stem cell that can differentiate into neurons is a clever combination that has not been explored before.\n3. The preclinical model used in the study is well-established and provides a solid basis for further validation.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. The study has a relatively small sample size, which may not be sufficient to represent the full range of neurodegenerative diseases.\n2. The authors do not discuss the long-term efficacy and safety of the treatment, which is a crucial aspect to consider when developing a new therapeutic approach.\n3. The study only uses a preclinical model, which may not accurately reflect the human clinical scenario. Further studies in human patients are needed to validate the results.\n4. The authors do not discuss the cost and accessibility of the treatment, which is a significant concern in the development of new therapies.\n5. The study could benefit from more detailed information about the gene therapy and stem cell therapy protocols, including the specific techniques used and the experimental design.\n\n**Suggestions:**\n\n1. The authors should consider conducting further studies to increase the sample size and validate the results in a larger cohort of patients.\n2. The authors should conduct long-term studies to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the treatment in human patients.\n3. The authors should consider conducting studies to evaluate the cost and accessibility of the treatment.\n4. The authors should include more detailed information about the gene therapy and stem cell therapy protocols in the study.\n5. The authors should discuss the limitations of the study and the potential biases that may have affected the results.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, the paper presents a novel and innovative approach to treat neurodegenerative diseases, and the results are encouraging. However, the study has several limitations, and further studies are needed to validate the results and improve the treatment. With careful consideration of the limitations and suggestions, the authors can strengthen the study and make a significant contribution to the field.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nI recommend that the authors revise and resubmit the paper, taking into account the suggestions and criticisms provided in this review. The revised paper should include more detailed information about the gene therapy and stem cell therapy protocols, as well as more comprehensive information about the long-term efficacy and safety of the treatment. The authors should also discuss the cost and accessibility of the treatment and consider conducting further studies to increase the sample size and validate the results in a larger cohort of patients.",

        "title": "ZERO BUBBLE (ALMOST) PIPELINE PARALLELISM",
        "abstract": "Pipeline parallelism is one of the key components for large-scale distributed training, yet its efficiency suffers from pipeline bubbles which were deemed inevitable. In this work, we introduce a scheduling strategy that, to our knowledge, is the first to successfully achieve zero pipeline bubbles under synchronous training semantics. The key idea behind this improvement is to split the backward computation into two parts, one that computes gradient for the input and another that computes for the parameters. Based on this idea, we handcraft novel pipeline schedules that significantly outperform the baseline methods. We further develop an algorithm that automatically finds an optimal schedule based on specific model configuration and memory limit. Additionally, to truly achieve zero bubble, we introduce a novel technique to bypass synchronizations during the optimizer step. Experimental evaluations show that our method outperforms the 1F1B schedule up to 15% in throughput under a similar memory limit. This number can be further pushed to 30% when the memory constraint is relaxed. We believe our results mark a major step forward in harnessing the true potential of pipeline parallelism.

The authors did not discuss the potential limitations of the study, including the reliance on existing literature and the lack of longitudinal data.\n4. The study's conclusions were somewhat simplistic, implying that climate change is the primary driver of forest loss, without considering other factors, such as deforestation and urbanization.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1. The authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the inclusion and exclusion criteria for the systematic literature search.\n2. The authors could consider including more countries in the study to improve the representativeness of the results.\n3. The authors should discuss the potential limitations of the study, including the reliance on existing literature and the lack of longitudinal data.\n4. The authors could explore alternative explanations for forest loss, beyond climate change, to provide a more nuanced understanding of the complex relationships between forest systems and the environment.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nThis study contributes to our understanding of the impact of climate change on global forests, but its findings should be interpreted with caution due to the limitations of the study.

        "abstract": "The predictions of Large Language Models (LLMs) on downstream tasks often improve significantly when including examples of the input\u2013label relationship in the context. However, there is currently no consensus about how this in-context learning (ICL) ability of LLMs works. For example, while Xie et al. (2022) liken ICL to a general-purpose learning algorithm, Min et al. (2022b) argue ICL does not even learn label relationships from in-context examples. In this paper, we provide novel insights into how ICL leverages label information, revealing both capabilities and limitations. To ensure we obtain a comprehensive picture of ICL behavior, we study probabilistic aspects of ICL predictions and thoroughly examine the dynamics of ICL as more examples are provided. Our experiments show that ICL predictions almost always depend on in-context labels and that ICL can learn truly novel tasks in-context. However, we also find that ICL struggles to fully overcome prediction preferences acquired from pre-training data and, further, that ICL does not consider all in-context information equally.",

This study proposes a novel approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases using microRNA-based gene editing. We used CRISPR-Cas9 system to introduce microRNAs (miRNAs) into neurons, which can modulate the expression of target genes involved in neurodegenerative diseases.

        "title": "THE EFFECTIVENESS OF RANDOM FORGETTING FOR ROBUST GENERALIZATION",
        "abstract": "Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks, which can compromise their performance and accuracy. Adversarial Training (AT) has emerged as a popular approach for protecting neural networks against such attacks. However, a key challenge of AT is robust overfitting, where the network\u2019s robust performance on test data deteriorates with further training, thus hindering generalization. Motivated by the concept of active forgetting in the brain, we introduce a novel learning paradigm called \u201cForget to Mitigate Overfitting (FOMO)\". FOMO alternates between the forgetting phase, which randomly forgets a subset of weights and regulates the model\u2019s information through weight reinitialization, and the relearning phase, which emphasizes learning generalizable features. Our experiments on benchmark datasets and adversarial attacks show that FOMO alleviates robust overfitting by significantly reducing the gap between the best and last robust test accuracy while improving the state-of-the-art robustness. Furthermore, FOMO provides a better trade-off between standard and robust accuracy, outperforming baseline adversarial methods. Finally, our framework is robust to AutoAttacks and increases generalization in many real-world scenarios.1",

Since the seminal works devoted to EBMs dating back to the noughties, there have been a lot of efficient methods which solve the generative modelling problem by means of energy potentials (unnormalized likelihood functions). In contrast, the realm of Optimal Transport (OT) and, in particular, neural OT solvers is much less explored and limited by few recent works (excluding WGAN-based approaches which utilize OT as a loss function and do not model OT maps themselves). In our work, we bridge the gap between EBMs and Entropy-regularized OT. We present a novel methodology which allows utilizing the recent developments and technical improvements of the former in order to enrich the latter. From the theoretical perspective, we prove generalization bounds for our technique. In practice, we validate its applicability in toy 2D and image domains. To showcase the scalability, we empower our method with a pre-trained StyleGAN and apply it to high-res AFHQ 512 \u00d7 512 unpaired I2I translation. For simplicity, we choose simple shortand long-run EBMs as a backbone of our Energy-guided Entropic OT approach, leaving the application of more sophisticated EBMs for future research.

        "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has witnessed great progress with various improvements in the self-training framework with pseudo labeling. The main challenge is how to distinguish high-quality pseudo labels against the confirmation bias. However, existing pseudo-label selection strategies are limited to pre-defined schemes or complex hand-crafted policies specially designed for classification, failing to achieve high-quality labels, fast convergence, and task versatility simultaneously. To these ends, we propose a Semi-supervised Reward framework (SemiReward) that predicts reward scores to evaluate and filter out high-quality pseudo labels, which is pluggable to mainstream SSL methods in wide task types and scenarios. To mitigate confirmation bias, SemiReward is trained online in two stages with a generator model and subsampling strategy. With classification and regression tasks on 13 standard SSL benchmarks across three modalities, extensive experiments verify that SemiReward achieves significant performance gains and faster convergence speeds upon Pseudo Label, FlexMatch, and Free/SoftMatch.

This study proposes a novel approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases using microRNA-based gene editing. We used CRISPR-Cas9 system to introduce microRNAs (miRNAs) into neurons, which can modulate the expression of target genes involved in neurodegenerative diseases.

        "abstract": "Relying on prior knowledge accumulated from related tasks, meta-learning offers a powerful approach to learning a novel task from limited training data. Recent approaches parameterize the prior with a family of probability density functions or recurrent neural networks, whose parameters can be optimized by utilizing validation data from the observed tasks. While these approaches have appealing empirical performance, the expressiveness of their prior is relatively low, which limits the generalization and interpretation of meta-learning. Aiming at expressive yet meaningful priors, this contribution puts forth a novel prior representation model that leverages the notion of algorithm unrolling. The key idea is to unroll the proximal gradient descent steps, where learnable piecewise linear functions are developed to approximate the desired proximal operators within tight theoretical error bounds established for both smooth and non-smooth proximal functions. The resultant multi-block neural network not only broadens the scope of learnable priors, but also enhances interpretability from an optimization viewpoint. Numerical tests conducted on few-shot learning datasets demonstrate markedly improved performance with flexible, visualizable, and understandable priors.",

        "abstract": "With the rapid growth of large language models (LLMs), there is increasing demand for memory and computation for LLMs. Recent efforts on post-training pruning of LLMs aim to reduce the model size and computation, yet the performance is still sub-optimal. In this paper, we present a plug-and-play solution for post-training pruning of LLMs. The proposed solution has two innovative components: 1) Relative Importance and Activations (RIA), a new pruning metric that jointly considers the weight and activations efficiently on LLMs; and 2) Channel Permutation, a new approach to maximally preserve important weights under N:M sparsity. The proposed two components can be readily combined to further enhance the N:M structured pruned LLMs. Our empirical experiments show that RIA alone can already surpass all existing post-training pruning methods on prevalent LLMs, e.g., LLaMA ranging from 7B to 65B. Furthermore, N:M structured pruning with channel permutation can even outperform the original LLaMA2 70B on zero-shot tasks, together with practical speed-up on specific hardware.",

        "abstract": "We introduce DIFFTACTILE, a physics-based differentiable tactile simulation system designed to enhance robotic manipulation with dense and physically accurate tactile feedback. In contrast to prior tactile simulators which primarily focus on manipulating rigid bodies and often rely on simplified approximations to model stress and deformations of materials in contact, DIFFTACTILE emphasizes physics-based contact modeling with high fidelity, supporting simulations of diverse contact modes and interactions with objects possessing a wide range of material properties. Our system incorporates several key components, including a Finite Element Method (FEM)-based soft body model for simulating the sensing elastomer, a multi-material simulator for modeling diverse object types (such as elastic, elastoplastic, cables) under manipulation, a penalty-based contact model for handling contact dynamics. The differentiable nature of our system facilitates gradient-based optimization for both 1) refining physical properties in simulation using real-world data, hence narrowing the sim-to-real gap and 2) efficient learning of tactile-assisted grasping and contact-rich manipulation skills. Additionally, we introduce a method to infer the optical response of our tactile sensor to contact using an efficient pixel-based neural module. We anticipate that DIFFTACTILE will serve as a useful platform for studying contact-rich manipulations, leveraging the benefits of dense tactile feedback and differentiable physics.

Our approach involves the design of a novel microRNA-targeting system that utilizes a combination of microRNA mimics, siRNA, and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease, where we achieve significant reductions in amyloid-\u03b2 plaque formation, tau tangles, and cognitive decline. Our results suggest that this novel therapeutic approach has the potential for treating a range of neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**Introduction:**\nNeurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, are characterized by the progressive loss of neurons in the brain, leading to cognitive decline, motor dysfunction, and eventually death. The underlying causes of these diseases are complex, but they involve the dysregulation of gene expression, leading to the accumulation of toxic proteins, such as amyloid-\u03b2, tau, and \u03b1-synuclein. Recent advances in gene editing technology have provided new opportunities for treating these diseases, but current approaches are often plagued by off-target effects, low efficiency, and toxicity.\n\n**Methods:**\nOur approach involves the design of a novel microRNA-targeting system that utilizes a combination of microRNA mimics, siRNA, and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology. We design a microRNA that targets the gene responsible for the accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2, tau, or \u03b1-synuclein, depending on the specific disease model. We then introduce the microRNA into the mouse brain using a viral vector, where it induces the expression of a siRNA that targets the same gene. The siRNA then induces the degradation of the gene, leading to a reduction in the accumulation of toxic proteins. We also introduce CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology to modify the gene responsible for the accumulation of toxic proteins, thereby preventing its expression.\n\n**Results:**\nWe demonstrate the efficacy of our novel therapeutic approach in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease. We achieve significant reductions in amyloid-\u03b2 plaque formation, tau tangles, and cognitive decline. We also observe a significant reduction in the expression of the gene responsible for the accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2, tau, or \u03b1-synuclein. Our results suggest that this novel therapeutic approach has the potential for treating a range of neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**Discussion:**\nOur results demonstrate the efficacy of our novel therapeutic approach in treating neurodegenerative diseases. The combination of microRNA-targeting, siRNA, and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology provides a novel approach for treating these diseases. The approach is highly specific, efficient, and safe, making it a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**Limitations:**\nOne limitation of our approach is that it is still in the early stages of development, and further studies are needed to fully characterize its efficacy and safety. Additionally, the approach may not be suitable for all neurodegenerative diseases, as the specific microRNA-targeting system may vary depending on the disease model.\n\n**Future Directions:**\nFuture studies should focus on further characterizing the efficacy and safety of our novel therapeutic approach. We should also explore the potential of this approach for treating other neurodegenerative diseases, such as Parkinson's disease, Huntington's disease, and frontotemporal dementia.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\nThe paper \"Development of a Novel Therapeutic Approach for Treating Neurodegenerative Diseases using MicroRNA-Based Gene Editing\" by Dr. Jane Smith, Dr. John Doe, Dr. Emily Chen presents a novel approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases using microRNA-based gene editing. The approach involves the design of a novel microRNA-targeting system that utilizes a combination of microRNA mimics, siRNA, and CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing technology.\n\nThe introduction is well-written, providing a clear overview of the current challenges in treating neurodegenerative diseases. The methods section is also well-written, providing a clear description of the approach used. The results section is impressive, demonstrating significant reductions in amyloid-\u03b2 plaque formation, tau tangles, and cognitive decline in a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nHowever, there are some limitations in the paper. The discussion section is somewhat brief, providing little insight into the potential limitations of the approach. Additionally, the paper does not provide sufficient information on the off-target effects of the approach, which is a critical consideration in gene editing technology.\n\nFurthermore, the paper does not provide sufficient information on the specificity of the microRNA-targeting system. The paper states that the microRNA-targeting system is designed to target the gene responsible for the accumulation of amyloid-\u03b2, tau, or \u03b1-synuclein, but it does not provide sufficient information on the specificity of the system.\n\nOverall, the paper presents a novel approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases using microRNA-based gene editing. However, further studies are needed to fully characterize the efficacy and safety of the approach, as well as the potential off-target effects.\n\n**Rating:** 8/10\n\n**Suggestions for improvement:**\n\n1. Provide more information on the specificity of the microRNA-targeting system.\n2. Provide more information on the off-target effects of the approach.\n3. Provide more information on the potential limitations of the approach.\n4. Provide more information on the potential benefits of the approach for treating other neurodegenerative diseases.\n5. Consider including more data on the safety of the approach.\n\n**Reviewer's Disclosure:** The reviewer declares no conflict of interest.",

        "abstract": "By contextualizing the kernel as global as possible, Modern ConvNets have shown great potential in computer vision tasks. However, recent progress on multi-order game-theoretic interaction within deep neural networks (DNNs) reveals the representation bottleneck of modern ConvNets, where the expressive interactions have not been effectively encoded with the increased kernel size. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new family of modern ConvNets, dubbed MogaNet, for discriminative visual representation learning in pure ConvNet-based models with favorable complexity-performance trade-offs. MogaNet encapsulates conceptually simple yet effective convolutions and gated aggregation into a compact module, where discriminative features are efficiently gathered and contextualized adaptively. MogaNet exhibits great scalability, impressive efficiency of parameters, and competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art ViTs and ConvNets on ImageNet and various downstream vision benchmarks, including COCO object detection, ADE20K semantic segmentation, 2D&3D human pose estimation, and video prediction. Notably, MogaNet hits 80.0% and 87.8% accuracy with 5.2M and 181M parameters on ImageNet-1K, outperforming ParC-Net and ConvNeXtL, while saving 59% FLOPs and 17M parameters, respectively.

The authors claim that their approach has shown promising results in a Phase I clinical study, with significant improvements in patient outcomes.\n\n**Methodology:**\nThe study employed a randomized, double-blinded, and controlled design. A total of 30 patients with advanced-stage cancer were enrolled in the study, and were randomly assigned to either the treatment group or the control group. The treatment group received the novel therapeutic approach, while the control group received standard chemotherapy. The patients in both groups received regular follow-up assessments, including tumor size measurements and laboratory tests.\n\n**Results:**\nThe results of the study show that the treatment group experienced significant improvements in tumor size and overall health, compared to the control group.

The authors, Lee and Park, have employed a range of machine learning algorithms to analyze soil erosion data. The paper has been peer-reviewed by the International Journal of Environmental Science and Technology (IJEST) and has been accepted.\n\n**Methodology:**\nIn this paper, the authors used a dataset containing information on soil type, slope, and rainfall patterns. The dataset consisted of 1000 samples, with 80% of the samples used as the training set and 20% as the testing set. The authors used a range of machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), to analyze the data. The results of these algorithms were then used to predict soil erosion risk.\n\n**Results:**\nThe results of the analysis showed that the Random Forest algorithm performed the best, with an accuracy of 92% and an area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROCAUC) curve of 0.95. The SVM algorithm performed second best, with an accuracy of 88% and an area under the ROCAUC curve of 0.92. The GBM algorithm performed the worst, with an accuracy of 82% and an area under the ROCAUC curve of 0.89.\n\n**Discussion:**\nThe authors discuss the results of the analysis and suggest that the Random Forest algorithm is the most effective in predicting soil erosion risk. They also suggest that the SVM algorithm is a close second, but has limitations in handling high-dimensional data. The GBM algorithm is suggested to be less effective due to its high computational complexity.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn conclusion, the authors have developed a novel algorithmic framework to predict soil erosion risk using machine learning techniques. The results of the analysis show that the Random Forest algorithm is the most effective in predicting soil erosion risk, followed by the SVM algorithm. The authors suggest that their framework can be used to predict soil erosion risk in various regions and can be improved by incorporating additional data sources.\n\n**Critical Review:**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. The authors have used a range of machine learning algorithms to analyze the data, which provides a comprehensive understanding of the results.\n\n2. The paper presents clear and concise results, making it easy to understand the methodology and the results.\n\n3. The authors have discussed the limitations of the algorithms used and suggested potential improvements.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. The dataset used in the paper is relatively small, with only 1000 samples. This may limit the generalizability of the results.\n\n2. The authors have only used a single feature set, which may limit the applicability of the framework to different regions and contexts.\n\n3. The paper does not discuss the potential biases and errors in the dataset, which may affect the accuracy of the results.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. The authors should increase the sample size of the dataset to improve the generalizability of the results.\n\n2. The authors should incorporate additional data sources, such as remote sensing data, to improve the accuracy of the framework.\n\n3. The authors should discuss the potential biases and errors in the dataset and how they affect the accuracy of the results.\n\n**Future Research Directions:**\n\n1. The authors should explore the use of other machine learning algorithms, such as neural networks and ensemble learning, to improve the accuracy of the framework.\n\n2. The authors should investigate the use of additional data sources, such as remote sensing data, to improve the accuracy of the framework.\n\n3. The authors should discuss the potential limitations and biases of the framework and suggest potential improvements.\n\n**Final Verdict:**\nThis paper presents a novel algorithmic framework to predict soil erosion risk using machine learning techniques. While the results show that the Random Forest algorithm is the most effective in predicting soil erosion risk, the limitations of the dataset and the algorithms used should be taken into consideration. The authors should increase the sample size of the dataset and incorporate additional data sources to improve the accuracy of the framework. Overall, the paper provides a useful contribution to the field of soil erosion prediction and highlights the potential of machine learning techniques in addressing this important issue.",

        "abstract": "In standard adversarial training, models are optimized to fit invariant one-hot labels for adversarial data when the perturbations are within allowable budgets. However, the overconfident target harms generalization and causes the problem of robust overfitting. To address this issue and enhance adversarial robustness, we analyze the characteristics of robust models and identify that robust models tend to produce smoother and well-calibrated outputs. Based on the observation, we propose a simple yet effective method, Annealing Self-Distillation Rectification (ADR), which generates soft labels as a better guidance mechanism that reflects the underlying distribution of data. By utilizing ADR, we can obtain rectified labels that improve model robustness without the need for pre-trained models or extensive extra computation. Moreover, our method facilitates seamless plug-andplay integration with other adversarial training techniques by replacing the hard labels in their objectives. We demonstrate the efficacy of ADR through extensive experiments and strong performances across datasets.",

        "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for training generalisable models on large-scale data in the fields of vision, text, and speech. Although SSL has been proven effective in speech and audio, its application to music audio has yet to be thoroughly explored. This is partially due to the distinctive challenges associated with modelling musical knowledge, particularly tonal and pitched characteristics of music. To address this research gap, we propose an acoustic Music undERstanding model with large-scale self-supervised Training (MERT), which incorporates teacher models to provide pseudo labels in the masked language modelling (MLM) style acoustic pre-training. In our exploration, we identified an effective combination of teacher models, which outperforms conventional speech and audio approaches in terms of performance. This combination includes an acoustic teacher based on Residual Vector Quantisation Variational AutoEncoder (RVQ-VAE) and a musical teacher based on the ConstantQ Transform (CQT). Furthermore, we explore a wide range of settings to overcome the instability in acoustic language model pre-training, which allows our designed paradigm to scale from 95M to 330M parameters. Experimental results indicate that our model can generalise and perform well on 14 music understanding tasks and attain state-of-the-art (SOTA) overall scores.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have presented compelling evidence that large language models (LLMs) can equip embodied agents with the self-driven capability to interact with the world, which marks an initial step toward versatile robotics. However, these efforts tend to overlook the visual richness of open worlds, rendering the entire interactive process akin to \u201ca blindfolded text-based game.\u201d Consequently, LLMbased agents frequently encounter challenges in intuitively comprehending their surroundings and producing responses that are easy to understand. In this paper, we propose Steve-Eye, an end-to-end trained large multimodal model to address this limitation. Steve-Eye integrates the LLM with a visual encoder to process visual-text inputs and generate multimodal feedback. We adopt a semi-automatic strategy to collect an extensive dataset comprising 850K open-world instruction pairs, enabling our model to encompass three essential functions for an agent: multimodal perception, foundational knowledge base, and skill prediction and planning. Lastly, we develop three open-world evaluation benchmarks, then carry out experiments from a wide range of perspectives to validate our model\u2019s capability to strategically act and plan. Codes and datasets will be released.",

Anxiety is a common comorbidity in individuals with ASD, affecting up to 50% of the population. Current treatments for anxiety in ASD are often ineffective, leading to a significant need for novel and evidence-based interventions.\n\n**Objectives:** The present study aimed to investigate the efficacy of a novel compound (Compound X) in reducing anxiety in individuals with ASD.\n\n**Methodology:** A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted, involving 50 participants (25 males, 25 females) between the ages of 18 and 40 years. Participants were diagnosed with ASD and experienced high levels of anxiety. Participants were randomly assigned to receive either Compound X or a placebo. Anxiety levels were measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) before and after 8 weeks of treatment.\n\n**Results:** The results showed that participants receiving Compound X exhibited significant reductions in anxiety levels compared to those receiving the placebo. Specifically, the SRS scores decreased by 25.6% in the treatment group, while the BAI scores decreased by 30.8% in the treatment group. These findings were statistically significant (p<0.01) and were maintained over the 8-week treatment period.\n\n**Discussion:** The results of this study provide strong evidence for the efficacy of Compound X in reducing anxiety in individuals with ASD. The findings are consistent with previous research, which has shown that individuals with ASD are more susceptible to anxiety and that novel interventions are needed to address this comorbidity.\n\n**Conclusion:** The present study demonstrates the potential of Compound X as a novel treatment for anxiety in individuals with ASD. Future studies are needed to investigate the long-term efficacy and potential side effects of Compound X in a larger population.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\nThe manuscript presents an interesting and timely study on the efficacy of a novel compound in reducing anxiety in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The authors' hypothesis is well-reasoned, and the study's methodology is well-designed. However, there are several concerns that need to be addressed.\n\nFirstly, the sample size is relatively small, and the participants' ages range from 18 to 40 years. While this may be a more homogeneous population, it is essential to consider the potential impact of age on anxiety levels and treatment outcomes. Additionally, the study did not include a control group for comorbidities or other treatments that may have influenced the results.\n\nSecondly, the authors' use of the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) and the Beck Anxiety Inventory (BAI) may not be the most sensitive measures for assessing anxiety in individuals with ASD. While these scales are commonly used, they may not capture the unique experiences and perspectives of individuals with autism.\n\nThirdly, the study's duration is relatively short, and the authors do not discuss potential long-term effects or maintenance of treatment outcomes. It is essential to consider the potential for relapse or the need for ongoing treatment.\n\nFourthly, the authors do not provide detailed information on the dosing regimen, side effects, or potential interactions of Compound X. While the authors claim that the compound is novel, it is essential to consider potential risks and benefits.\n\nLastly, the study's findings are based on a single trial, and it is essential to consider the potential for replication or external validity.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. The authors should consider conducting a larger, more diverse sample size and including a control group for comorbidities or other treatments.\n2. The authors should explore alternative measures for assessing anxiety in individuals with ASD, such as the Autism Anxiety Questionnaire (AAQ) or the Anxiety in Autism Scale (AAS).\n3. The authors should consider extending the study duration to assess long-term effects and maintenance of treatment outcomes.\n4. The authors should provide detailed information on the dosing regimen, side effects, and potential interactions of Compound X.\n5. The authors should consider conducting a replication study or meta-analysis to confirm the findings and assess external validity.\n\n**Rating:** 7/10\n\nThis manuscript presents a well-designed study on the efficacy of a novel compound in reducing anxiety in individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). However, the study's limitations and concerns need to be addressed to strengthen the findings and ensure the manuscript's quality.",

        "abstract": "Sorting is a fundamental operation of all computer systems, having been a longstanding significant research topic. Beyond the problem formulation of traditional sorting algorithms, we consider sorting problems for more abstract yet expressive inputs, e.g., multi-digit images and image fragments, through a neural sorting network. To learn a mapping from a high-dimensional input to an ordinal variable, the differentiability of sorting networks needs to be guaranteed. In this paper we define a softening error by a differentiable swap function, and develop an error-free swap function that holds a non-decreasing condition and differentiability. Furthermore, a permutation-equivariant Transformer network with multi-head attention is adopted to capture dependency between given inputs and also leverage its model capacity with self-attention. Experiments on diverse sorting benchmarks show that our methods perform better than or comparable to baseline methods.",

The approach involves the design of nanoparticles that can selectively deliver exenatide analogs to the pancreatic islets, where insulin is produced. The nanoparticles are engineered to have a specific size, shape, and surface charge to ensure targeted delivery. The authors demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach using a mouse model of diabetes, where the nanoparticles are shown to improve glucose control and reduce pancreatic islet injury.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Overall Impression:**\nThe paper presents an innovative approach to treating diabetes using nanoparticles to deliver exenatide analogs. The authors provide a clear and concise overview of the method, highlighting its potential benefits. However, the manuscript requires significant improvements to strengthen its scientific rigor, clarity, and overall quality.\n\n**Methodology:**\nThe authors describe the design of nanoparticles that can selectively deliver exenatide analogs to the pancreatic islets. However, the details of the nanoparticle design, synthesis, and characterization are not fully presented. The authors should provide more information on the materials used, the synthesis protocols, and the characterization techniques employed to ensure the nanoparticles are stable, biocompatible, and have the desired properties.\n\n**Animal Model:**\nThe authors use a mouse model of diabetes, which is a common approach. However, the model used is not explicitly stated, which may raise concerns about the generalizability of the results.

        "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the potential of Lipschitz-based methods for training certifiably robust neural networks against adversarial attacks. A key challenge, supported both theoretically and empirically, is that robustness demands greater network capacity and more data than standard training. However, effectively adding capacity under stringent Lipschitz constraints has proven more difficult than it may seem, evident by the fact that state-of-the-art approach tend more towards underfitting than overfitting. Moreover, we posit that a lack of careful exploration of the design space for Lipshitz-based approaches has left potential performance gains on the table. In this work, we provide a more comprehensive evaluation to better uncover the potential of Lipschitz-based certification methods. Using a combination of novel techniques, design optimizations, and synthesis of prior work, we are able to significantly improve the state-of-the-art VRA for deterministic certification on a variety of benchmark datasets, and over a range of perturbation sizes. Of particular note, we discover that the addition of large \u201cCholesky-orthogonalized residual dense\u201d layers to the end of existing state-of-the-art Lipschitz-controlled ResNet architectures is especially effective for increasing network capacity and performance. Combined with filtered generative data augmentation, our final results further the state of the art deterministic VRA by up to 8.5 percentage points.",

The authors propose that topological quantum error correction can be leveraged to enhance the robustness of quantum computations. The authors correctly identify the limitations of traditional quantum error correction methods, such as the need for robust quantum gates and the difficulty in scaling up quantum systems. However, the introduction lacks clarity on the fundamental principles of topological quantum error correction, which might make it challenging for non-experts to follow the paper.\n\n**Methodology:**\nThe authors propose the use of superconducting qubits to implement topological quantum error correction. They describe the theoretical framework for this approach, which involves creating topological codes using superconducting quantum interference devices. The authors also discuss the potential advantages of using superconducting qubits, such as their high coherence times and low noise levels. However, the methodology section lacks detailed explanations of the theoretical calculations and experimental implementation. The authors should provide more explicit derivations of the topological codes and discuss the experimental feasibility of implementing these codes.\n\n**Results:**\nThe authors report on the theoretical results of their simulation, which shows that the proposed topological quantum error correction scheme can effectively correct errors in quantum computations. However, the results are based on simplified assumptions and do not account for the complexities of real-world quantum systems. The authors should provide more detailed analysis of the errors and their corrections, as well as discuss the limitations of their simulation.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe authors provide an overview of the potential of topological quantum error correction with superconducting qubits. They correctly highlight the advantages of this approach, such as the robustness of topological codes and the potential for scaling up quantum systems.

        "abstract": "Designing effective positional encodings for graphs is key to building powerful graph transformers and enhancing message-passing graph neural networks. Although widespread, using Laplacian eigenvectors as positional encodings faces two fundamental challenges: (1) Non-uniqueness: there are many different eigendecompositions of the same Laplacian, and (2) Instability: small perturbations to the Laplacian could result in completely different eigenspaces, leading to unpredictable changes in positional encoding. Despite many attempts to address nonuniqueness, most methods overlook stability, leading to poor generalization on unseen graph structures. We identify the cause of instability to be a \u201chard partition\u201d of eigenspaces. Hence, we introduce Stable and Expressive Positional Encodings (SPE), an architecture for processing eigenvectors that uses eigenvalues to \u201csoftly partition\u201d eigenspaces. SPE is the first architecture that is (1) provably stable, and (2) universally expressive for basis invariant functions whilst respecting all symmetries of eigenvectors. Besides guaranteed stability, we prove that SPE is at least as expressive as existing methods, and highly capable of counting graph structures. Finally, we evaluate the effectiveness of our method on molecular property prediction, and out-of-distribution generalization tasks, finding improved generalization compared to existing positional encoding methods.",

(2022). \nJournal: Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment.\n\nHere is the study: \nThe study investigates the impact of climate change on global rice production using a spatial analysis framework. The authors utilized a panel of 56 countries and 30 years of climate and yield data to analyze the effects of climate change on rice production. The study employed a spatial autoregressive model (SAR) to examine the relationship between climate change and yield decline. The results show that climate change is significantly negatively correlated with rice production, indicating a decline in yield due to rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns.\n\nThe study also explored the effects of climate change on rice production in different regions. The authors found that the top 10% of countries with the highest rice production levels are experiencing the greatest yield decline due to climate change. The results suggest that the most vulnerable countries are those with limited economic resources, low levels of institutional capacity, and poor agricultural infrastructure.\n\nThe study concludes that climate change poses a significant threat to global rice production, and that targeted interventions are needed to support vulnerable countries in adapting to the impacts of climate change.\n\nHere is the peer review:\n**Peer Review: \"The Effects of Climate Change on Global Rice Production: A Spatial Analysis of Yield Decline\" by Zhang, Y., Lee, J., & Kim, J. (2022) in Agriculture, Ecosystems & Environment.**\n\n**Overall Impression:**\nThe study provides a comprehensive analysis of the impact of climate change on global rice production using a spatial analysis framework. The authors' use of a panel of 56 countries and 30 years of climate and yield data is commendable, and the SAR model is a suitable choice for examining the relationship between climate change and yield decline.\n\n**Methodological Strengths:**\n1. The study's use of a spatial autoregressive model (SAR) is a significant strength, allowing the authors to capture the spatial relationships and patterns in yield decline across different countries.\n2. The authors' selection of 56 countries and 30 years of climate and yield data provides a comprehensive dataset to analyze the effects of climate change on rice production.\n3. The results show a significant negative correlation between climate change and yield decline, indicating a decline in yield due to rising temperatures and changing precipitation patterns.\n\n**Methodological Limitations:**\n1. The study's reliance on a single model (SAR) might limit its generalizability to different contexts and regions.\n2. The authors did not control for potential confounding variables, such as soil quality, irrigation levels, and agricultural management practices, which might affect yield decline.\n3. The study's analysis focused on a panel of 56 countries, which might not be representative of all regions and countries experiencing climate change impacts on rice production.\n\n**Regional and Contextual Limitations:**\n1. The study's analysis focused on a global scale, which might not capture the nuances and complexities of regional climate change impacts on rice production.\n2. The authors did not explore the effects of climate change on rice production in different climate regions, such as tropical, subtropical, or temperate regions.\n3. The study's findings might not be applicable to countries with different agricultural systems, such as those with extensive or intensive rice production.\n\n**Conclusion and Recommendations:**\nThe study highlights the significant threat posed by climate change to global rice production. However, the findings should be interpreted with caution due to the limitations mentioned above.\n\nTo strengthen the study, the authors could:\n\n1. Explore the effects of climate change on rice production in different climate regions and countries.\n2. Incorporate additional variables, such as soil quality, irrigation levels, and agricultural management practices, to control for potential confounding factors.\n3. Use a more comprehensive set of indicators, such as the yield decline index, to quantify the effects of climate change on rice production.\n\n**Recommendations:**\nThe study's findings should be communicated to policy makers, researchers, and practitioners to raise awareness about the impacts of climate change on global rice production. The authors should also consider collaborating with international organizations and research institutions to develop targeted interventions and support vulnerable countries in adapting to the impacts of climate change.\n\n**Rating:**\nBased on the review, I would give this study a rating of 7.5 out of 10. The study provides a comprehensive analysis of the impact of climate change on global rice production, but its limitations and contextual constraints should be acknowledged and addressed in future research.",

        "abstract": "The application of machine learning (ML) in a range of geospatial tasks is increasingly common but often relies on globally available covariates such as satellite imagery that can either be expensive or lack predictive power. Here we explore the question of whether the vast amounts of knowledge found in Internet language corpora, now compressed within large language models (LLMs), can be leveraged for geospatial prediction tasks. We first demonstrate that LLMs embed remarkable spatial information about locations, but naively querying LLMs using geographic coordinates alone is ineffective in predicting key indicators like population density. We then present GeoLLM, a novel method that can effectively extract geospatial knowledge from LLMs with auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap. We demonstrate the utility of our approach across multiple tasks of central interest to the international community, including the measurement of population density and economic livelihoods. Across these tasks, our method demonstrates a 70% improvement in performance (measured using Pearson\u2019s r) relative to baselines that use nearest neighbors or use information directly from the prompt, and performance equal to or exceeding satellite-based benchmarks in the literature. With GeoLLM, we observe that GPT-3.5 outperforms Llama 2 and RoBERTa by 19% and 51% respectively, suggesting that the performance of our method scales well with the size of the model and its pretraining dataset. Our experiments reveal that LLMs are remarkably sample-efficient, rich in geospatial information, and robust across the globe. Crucially, GeoLLM shows promise in mitigating the limitations of existing geospatial covariates and complementing them well.

In this study, we present a novel biomaterial composed of poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) (PLGA) and hyaluronic acid (HA), which exhibits improved mechanical properties compared to traditional PLGA scaffolds. The bioprinted scaffold was fabricated using a combination of 3D printing and electrostatic assembly, resulting in a highly porous and fibrous microenvironment that supports cell adhesion and growth. The mechanical properties of the scaffold were evaluated using uniaxial tensile testing, and the cytocompatibility of the material was assessed using MTT assay. The results show that the bioprinted scaffold exhibits enhanced mechanical properties, including improved tensile strength and Young's modulus, compared to traditional PLGA scaffolds. Additionally, the scaffold demonstrated good cytocompatibility, with no significant cytotoxic effects detected. These findings suggest that the bioprinted scaffold with HA is a promising material for tissue engineering applications, offering improved mechanical properties and cytocompatibility.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nTissue engineering is a rapidly growing field that aims to develop biodegradable scaffolds for the regeneration of tissues and organs. Bioprinted scaffolds have emerged as a promising approach for tissue engineering, offering the potential for precise control over scaffold architecture and material properties. However, the mechanical properties of bioprinted scaffolds can be limited, leading to inadequate cell adhesion and growth. In this study, we aim to develop a bioprinted scaffold with enhanced mechanical properties using a combination of 3D printing and electrostatic assembly.\n\n**Materials and Methods:**\n\nThe bioprinted scaffold was fabricated using a combination of 3D printing and electrostatic assembly. The PLGA-HA composite material was prepared by dissolving PLGA and HA in a solvent and then extruding the mixture through a 0.5 mm diameter nozzle. The resulting filament was then cut into 5 mm long segments, which were assembled into a 3D scaffold using electrostatic assembly. The scaffold was then sterilized and incubated with fetal bovine serum (FBS) for 24 hours to promote cell adhesion and growth.\n\n**Results:**\n\nThe mechanical properties of the scaffold were evaluated using uniaxial tensile testing, and the cytocompatibility of the material was assessed using MTT assay. The results show that the bioprinted scaffold exhibits enhanced mechanical properties, including improved tensile strength and Young's modulus, compared to traditional PLGA scaffolds. Additionally, the scaffold demonstrated good cytocompatibility, with no significant cytotoxic effects detected.\n\n**Discussion:**\n\nThe addition of HA to the PLGA scaffold improved its mechanical properties, likely due to the synergistic effect of HA and PLGA. HA is a highly hydrated polymer that can provide mechanical reinforcement and improve the scaffold's ability to withstand deformation. The bioprinted scaffold exhibited improved tensile strength and Young's modulus, suggesting that the HA-PGLA composite material is an effective approach for developing bioprinted scaffolds with enhanced mechanical properties.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe bioprinted scaffold with HA is a promising material for tissue engineering applications, offering improved mechanical properties and cytocompatibility. The addition of HA to the PLGA scaffold improved its mechanical properties, likely due to the synergistic effect of HA and PLGA. These findings suggest that the bioprinted scaffold with HA is a promising material for tissue engineering applications, and further studies are needed to explore its potential in regenerative medicine.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe paper presents an interesting approach to developing bioprinted scaffolds with enhanced mechanical properties using a combination of 3D printing and electrostatic assembly.

We examined the effects of varying temperature treatments (25\u00b0C, 30\u00b0C, 32\u00b0C, and 34\u00b0C) for 7 weeks. Our results showed that the optimal temperature for wheat growth was 30\u00b0C, resulting in the highest yield and quality parameters. The optimal temperature for grain quality was 32\u00b0C. We also observed that higher temperatures resulted in increased yield, but decreased grain quality. These findings have implications for wheat production and can be used to develop more resilient and productive wheat varieties.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n**Overall Impression:**\nThis study contributes to the understanding of the effects of temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality. The authors have presented a clear and concise experimental design, which allows for the exploration of the impact of temperature treatments on wheat growth.\n\n**Strengths:**\n1. **Experimental Design:** The authors have employed a well-designed experiment with multiple temperature treatments, which enables the examination of the effects of temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality. The use of a control temperature (25\u00b0C) provides a benchmark for comparison.\n2. **Statistical Analysis:** The authors have used a statistical analysis to compare the effects of different temperature regimes. However, it would be beneficial to include more detailed information about the statistical methods used, including the types of tests and the significance levels.\n3. **Results Presentation:** The results are presented in a clear and concise manner, making it easy to understand the effects of different temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n1. **Limited Sample Size:** The study has a relatively small sample size (n=5), which may limit the generalizability of the results. Increasing the sample size would enhance the reliability of the findings.\n2. **Lack of Replication:** The study does not include replication of the results, which is essential for validating the findings. Replication would also enable the authors to explore potential sources of variation.\n3. **Limited Context:** The study does not consider the potential impact of temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality in different agroecological contexts. This is an essential aspect to consider, as temperature regimes can vary significantly across different regions.\n\n**Suggestions for Future Research:**\n1. **Increase Sample Size:** Conduct a larger-scale experiment to increase the sample size and enhance the reliability of the findings.\n2. **Replication:** Replicate the results to validate the findings and explore potential sources of variation.\n3. **Consider Multiple Factors:** Investigate the impact of multiple factors, including temperature, water availability, and soil quality, to gain a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality.\n\n**Rating:** 8/10\n\n**Recommendation:**\nThis study provides valuable insights into the effects of temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality. However, to further enhance the reliability and generalizability of the findings, it is recommended that the authors conduct a larger-scale experiment, replicate the results, and consider multiple factors. With these enhancements, the study would be more robust and would contribute significantly to the field of wheat production.",

This constraint limits the incorporation of relevant social network data into blockchain analysis, thereby diminishing the breadth and depth of insight that can be derived. To address the above limitation, we introduce EX-Graph, a novel dataset that authentically links Ethereum and X, marking the first and largest dataset of its kind. EX-Graph combines Ethereum transaction records (2 million nodes and 30 million edges) and X following data (1 million nodes and 3 million edges), bonding 30,667 Ethereum addresses with verified X accounts sourced from OpenSea. Detailed statistical analysis on EXGraph highlights the structural differences between X-matched and non-X-matched Ethereum addresses. Extensive experiments, including Ethereum link prediction, wash-trading Ethereum addresses detection, and X-Ethereum matching link prediction, emphasize the significant role of X data in enhancing Ethereum analysis.

        "abstract": "Bandwidth constraints during signal acquisition frequently impede real-time detection applications. Hyperspectral data is a notable example, whose vast volume compromises real-time hyperspectral detection. To tackle this hurdle, we introduce a novel approach leveraging pre-acquisition modulation to reduce the acquisition volume. This modulation process is governed by a deep learning model, utilizing prior information. Central to our approach is LUM-ViT, a Vision Transformer variant. Uniquely, LUM-ViT incorporates a learnable under-sampling mask tailored for pre-acquisition modulation. To further optimize for optical calculations, we propose a kernel-level weight binarization technique and a threestage fine-tuning strategy. Our evaluations reveal that, by sampling a mere 10% of the original image pixels, LUM-ViT maintains the accuracy loss within 1.8% on the ImageNet classification task. The method sustains near-original accuracy when implemented on real-world optical hardware, demonstrating its practicality. Code will be available at https://github.com/MaxLLF/LUM-ViT.",

        "title": "CURRICULUM REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR QUANTUM ARCHITECTURE SEARCH UNDER HARD-",
        "abstract": "The key challenge in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era is finding useful circuits compatible with current device limitations. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) offer a potential solution by fixing the circuit architecture and optimizing individual gate parameters in an external loop. However, parameter optimization can become intractable, and the overall performance of the algorithm depends heavily on the initially chosen circuit architecture. Several quantum architecture search (QAS) algorithms have been developed to design useful circuit architectures automatically. In the case of parameter optimization alone, noise effects have been observed to dramatically influence the performance of the optimizer and final outcomes, which is a key line of study. However, the effects of noise on the architecture search, which could be just as critical, are poorly understood. This work addresses this gap by introducing a curriculum-based reinforcement learning QAS (CRLQAS) algorithm designed to tackle challenges in realistic VQA deployment. The algorithm incorporates (i) a 3D architecture encoding and restrictions on environment dynamics to explore the search space of possible circuits efficiently, (ii) an episode halting scheme to steer the agent to find shorter circuits, and (iii) a novel variant of simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation as an optimizer for faster convergence. To facilitate studies, we developed an optimized simulator for our algorithm, significantly improving computational efficiency in simulating noisy quantum circuits by employing the Pauli-transfer matrix formalism in the Pauli-Liouville basis.

        "title": "GIM: LEARNING GENERALIZABLE IMAGE MATCHER",
        "abstract": "Image matching is a fundamental computer vision problem. While learning-based methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks, they generalize poorly to in-the-wild images. Such methods typically need to train separate models for different scene types (e.g., indoor vs. outdoor) and are impractical when the scene type is unknown in advance. One of the underlying problems is the limited scalability of existing data construction pipelines, which limits the diversity of standard image matching datasets. To address this problem, we propose GIM, a self-training framework for learning a single generalizable model based on any image matching architecture using internet videos, an abundant and diverse data source. Given an architecture, GIM first trains it on standard domain-specific datasets and then combines it with complementary matching methods to create dense labels on nearby frames of novel videos. These labels are filtered by robust fitting, and then enhanced by propagating them to distant frames. The final model is trained on propagated data with strong augmentations. Not relying on complex 3D reconstruction makes GIM much more efficient and less likely to fail than standard SfM-and-MVS based frameworks. We also propose ZEB, the first zero-shot evaluation benchmark for image matching. By mixing data from diverse domains, ZEB can thoroughly assess the cross-domain generalization performance of different methods. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of GIM. Applying GIM consistently improves the zero-shot performance of 3 state-of-theart image matching architectures as the number of downloaded videos increases (Fig. 1 (a)); with 50 hours of YouTube videos, the relative zero-shot performance improves by 8.4% \u2212 18.1%. GIM also enables generalization to extreme crossdomain data such as Bird Eye View (BEV) images of projected 3D point clouds (Fig. 1 (c)). More importantly, our single zero-shot model consistently outperforms domain-specific baselines when evaluated on downstream tasks inherent to their respective domains. The code will be released upon acceptance.",

        "abstract": "If generalist robots are to operate in truly unstructured environments, they need to be able to recognize and reason about novel objects and scenarios. Such objects and scenarios might not be present in the robot\u2019s own training data. We propose SuSIE, a method that leverages an image editing diffusion model to act as a high-level planner by proposing intermediate subgoals that a low-level controller attains. Specifically, we fine-tune InstructPix2Pix on robot data such that it outputs a hypothetical future observation given the robot\u2019s current observation and a language command. We then use the same robot data to train a low-level goalconditioned policy to reach a given image observation. We find that when these components are combined, the resulting system exhibits robust generalization capabilities. The high-level planner utilizes its Internet-scale pre-training and visual understanding to guide the low-level goal-conditioned policy, achieving significantly better generalization than conventional language-conditioned policies. We demonstrate that this approach solves real robot control tasks involving novel objects, distractors, and even environments, both in the real world and in simulation.

        "abstract": "This paper introduces a new method for minimizing matrix-smooth non-convex objectives through the use of novel Compressed Gradient Descent (CGD) algorithms enhanced with a matrix-valued stepsize. The proposed algorithms are theoretically analyzed first in the single-node and subsequently in the distributed settings. Our theoretical results reveal that the matrix stepsize in CGD can capture the objective\u2019s structure and lead to faster convergence compared to a scalar stepsize. As a byproduct of our general results, we emphasize the importance of selecting the compression mechanism and the matrix stepsize in a layer-wise manner, taking advantage of model structure. Moreover, we provide theoretical guarantees for free compression, by designing specific layer-wise compressors for the non-convex matrix smooth objectives. Our findings are supported with empirical evidence.",

        "title": "DEMYSTIFYING LOCAL & GLOBAL FAIRNESS TRADE-OFFS IN FEDERATED LEARNING USING PARTIAL INFORMATION DECOMPOSITION",
        "abstract": "This work presents an information-theoretic perspective to group fairness trade-offs in federated learning (FL) with respect to sensitive attributes, such as gender, race, etc. Existing works often focus on either global fairness (overall disparity of the model across all clients) or local fairness (disparity of the model at each client), without always considering their trade-offs. There is a lack of understanding of the interplay between global and local fairness in FL, particularly under data heterogeneity, and if and when one implies the other. To address this gap, we leverage a body of work in information theory called partial information decomposition (PID), which first identifies three sources of unfairness in FL, namely, Unique Disparity, Redundant Disparity, and Masked Disparity. We demonstrate how these three disparities contribute to global and local fairness using canonical examples. This decomposition helps us derive fundamental limits on the trade-off between global and local fairness, highlighting where they agree or disagree. We introduce the Accuracy & Global-Local Fairness Optimality Problem (AGLFOP), a convex optimization that defines the theoretical limits of accuracy and fairness trade-offs, identifying the best possible performance any FL strategy can attain given a dataset and client distribution. We also present experimental results on synthetic datasets and the ADULT dataset to support our theoretical findings.",

        "abstract": "Transformers for time series forecasting mainly model time series from limited or fixed scales, making it challenging to capture different characteristics spanning various scales. We propose Pathformer, a multi-scale Transformer with adaptive pathways. It integrates both temporal resolution and temporal distance for multi-scale modeling. Multi-scale division divides the time series into different temporal resolutions using patches of various sizes. Based on the division of each scale, dual attention is performed over these patches to capture global correlations and local details as temporal dependencies. We further enrich the multiscale Transformer with adaptive pathways, which adaptively adjust the multi-scale modeling process based on the varying temporal dynamics of the input, improving the accuracy and generalization of Pathformer. Extensive experiments on eleven real-world datasets demonstrate that Pathformer not only achieves state-of-the-art performance by surpassing all current models but also exhibits stronger generalization abilities under various transfer scenarios. The code is made available at https://github.com/decisionintelligence/pathformer.",

Our approach combines a convolutional neural network (CNN) with a recurrent neural network (RNN) to model the complex interactions between proteins and ligands. The proposed algorithm is trained on a large dataset of protein-ligand complexes and achieves high accuracy in predicting binding affinity. We evaluate the performance of the algorithm using various metrics, including mean absolute error (MAE) and mean squared error (MSE).\n\n**Introduction:**\nProtein-ligand binding affinity is a critical parameter in understanding the mechanisms of protein-ligand interactions. Accurate prediction of binding affinity is crucial in various fields, including drug discovery and disease research. Traditional machine learning approaches have been used to predict protein-ligand binding affinity, but they often suffer from limited accuracy and interpretability. In this paper, we present a novel algorithm for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity using deep learning techniques.\n\n**Methodology:**\nOur approach combines a CNN with an RNN to model the complex interactions between proteins and ligands. The CNN is used to extract features from the protein-ligand complex, while the RNN is used to model the temporal dynamics of the interactions. The proposed algorithm is trained on a large dataset of protein-ligand complexes, which includes 10,000 protein-ligand complexes with binding affinities ranging from 0 to 1000 nM.\n\n**Training and Evaluation:**\nThe proposed algorithm is trained using a combination of forward and backward propagation. The loss function used is the mean squared error (MSE), which is a measure of the difference between predicted and actual binding affinities. The algorithm is evaluated using various metrics, including MAE and MSE.\n\n**Results:**\nThe proposed algorithm achieves high accuracy in predicting binding affinity, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.23 nM and a mean squared error (MSE) of 0.45 nM. The algorithm also exhibits good interpretability, with features extracted by the CNN being relevant to the binding affinity.\n\n**Discussion:**\nThe proposed algorithm demonstrates the potential of deep learning techniques for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity. The results show that the algorithm is able to achieve high accuracy and interpretability, making it a valuable tool for researchers in the field. However, the algorithm is limited by the quality of the training dataset, which may not be representative of all protein-ligand complexes.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn conclusion, we present a novel algorithm for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity using deep learning techniques. The proposed algorithm achieves high accuracy and interpretability, making it a valuable tool for researchers in the field. Future work should focus on improving the quality of the training dataset and exploring other deep learning architectures for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\nThe paper \"Development of a Novel Algorithm for Predicting Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity using Deep Learning Techniques\" presents an interesting approach to predicting protein-ligand binding affinity using deep learning techniques.

        "abstract": "Characterizing samples that are difficult to learn from is crucial to developing highly performant ML models. This has led to numerous Hardness Characterization Methods (HCMs) that aim to identify \u201chard\u201d samples. However, there is a lack of consensus regarding the definition and evaluation of \u201chardness\u201d. Unfortunately, current HCMs have only been evaluated on specific types of hardness and often only qualitatively or with respect to downstream performance, overlooking the fundamental quantitative identification task. We address this gap by presenting a fine-grained taxonomy of hardness types. Additionally, we propose the Hardness Characterization Analysis Toolkit (H-CAT), which supports comprehensive and quantitative benchmarking of HCMs across the hardness taxonomy and can easily be extended to new HCMs, hardness types, and datasets. We use H-CAT to evaluate 13 different HCMs across 8 hardness types. This comprehensive evaluation encompassing over 14K setups uncovers strengths and weaknesses of different HCMs, leading to practical tips to guide HCM selection and future development. Our findings highlight the need for more comprehensive HCM evaluation, while we hope our hardness taxonomy and toolkit will advance the principled evaluation and uptake of data-centric AI methods.",

        "abstract": "Grounding the abstract knowledge captured by Large Language Models (LLMs) in physical domains remains a pivotal yet unsolved problem. Whereas prior works have largely focused on leveraging LLMs for generating abstract plans in symbolic spaces, this work uses LLMs to guide the learning for structures and constraints in robot manipulation tasks. Specifically, we borrow from manipulation planning literature the concept of mode families, defining specific types of motion constraints among sets of objects, to serve as an intermediate layer that connects high-level language representations with low-level physical trajectories. By locally perturbing a small set of successful human demonstrations, we augment the dataset with additional successful executions as well as counterfactuals that fail the task. Our explanation-based learning framework trains neural network-based classifiers to differentiate success task executions from failures and as a by-product learns classifiers that ground low-level states into mode families without dense labeling. This further enables us to learn structured policies for the target task. Experimental validation in both 2D continuous-space and robotic manipulation environments demonstrates the robustness of our mode-based imitation methods under external perturbations.",

        "title": "IMPROVING EQUILIBRIUM PROPAGATION WITHOUT WEIGHT SYMMETRY THROUGH JACOBIAN HOMEOSTASIS",
        "abstract": "Equilibrium propagation (EP) is a compelling alternative to the backpropagation of error algorithm (BP) for computing gradients of neural networks on biological or analog neuromorphic substrates. Still, the algorithm requires weight symmetry and infinitesimal equilibrium perturbations, i.e., nudges, to yield unbiased gradient estimates. Both requirements are challenging to implement in physical systems. Yet, whether and how weight asymmetry contributes to bias is unknown because, in practice, its contribution may be masked by a finite nudge. To address this question, we study generalized EP, which can be formulated without weight symmetry, and analytically isolate the two sources of bias. For complex-differentiable non-symmetric networks, we show that bias due to finite nudge can be avoided by estimating exact derivatives via a Cauchy integral. In contrast, weight asymmetry induces residual bias through poor alignment of EP\u2019s neuronal error vectors compared to BP resulting in low task performance. To mitigate the latter issue, we present a new homeostatic objective that directly penalizes functional asymmetries of the Jacobian at the network\u2019s fixed point. This homeostatic objective dramatically improves the network\u2019s ability to solve complex tasks such as ImageNet 32\u00d732. Our results lay the theoretical groundwork for studying and mitigating the adverse effects of imperfections of physical networks on learning algorithms that rely on the substrate\u2019s relaxation dynamics.",

        "abstract": "Maintaining legacy software requires many software and systems engineering hours. Assembly code programs, which demand low-level control over the computer machine state and have no variable names, are particularly difficult for humans to analyze. Existing conventional program translators guarantee correctness, but are hand-engineered for the source and target programming languages in question. Learned transpilation, i.e. automatic translation of code, offers an alternative to manual re-writing and engineering efforts. Automated symbolic program translation approaches guarantee correctness but struggle to scale to longer programs due to the exponentially large search space. Their rigid rule-based systems also limit their expressivity, so they can only reason about a reduced space of programs. Probabilistic neural language models (LMs) produce plausible outputs for every input, but do so at the cost of guaranteed correctness. In this work, we leverage the strengths of LMs and symbolic solvers in a neurosymbolic approach to learned transpilation for assembly code. Assembly code is an appropriate setting for a neurosymbolic approach, since assembly code can be divided into shorter non-branching basic blocks amenable to the use of symbolic methods. GUESS & SKETCH extracts alignment and confidence information from features of the LM then passes it to a symbolic solver to resolve semantic equivalence of the transpilation input and output. We test GUESS & SKETCH on three different test sets of assembly transpilation tasks, varying in difficulty, and show that it successfully transpiles 57.6% more examples than GPT-4 and 39.6% more examples than an engineered transpiler. We also share a training and evaluation dataset for this task.",

Four different temperatures (20, 25, 30, and 35\u00b0C) were used, with each treatment repeated three times. The results showed that the optimal growth rate was achieved at 25\u00b0C, while the highest yield was obtained at 30\u00b0C. However, the quality of the wheat was negatively impacted by high temperatures, with a significant decline in protein content and starch content. These findings have important implications for wheat production and suggest that optimal management of thermal stress is crucial for achieving high yields and quality.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nWheat (Triticum aestivum) is one of the most widely cultivated crops in the world, and its production is heavily influenced by environmental factors, including temperature. Temperature regimes can have a significant impact on wheat growth, yield, and quality. The optimal temperature range for wheat growth is generally considered to be between 20-30\u00b0C. However, the effects of different temperatures on wheat can vary greatly, and some studies have reported conflicting results.\n\n**Methods:**\n\nThis study used a controlled environment chamber with a controlled atmosphere. The chamber was set at four different temperatures (20, 25, 30, and 35\u00b0C), with each treatment repeated three times. Wheat seeds were planted in each treatment, and the plants were grown for 60 days. The yield and quality of the wheat were measured at the end of the experiment.\n\n**Results:**\n\nThe results showed that the optimal growth rate was achieved at 25\u00b0C, while the highest yield was obtained at 30\u00b0C. However, the quality of the wheat was negatively impacted by high temperatures, with a significant decline in protein content and starch content. The protein content decreased by 12.5% at 35\u00b0C compared to the control treatment at 20\u00b0C, while the starch content decreased by 18.5% at 35\u00b0C compared to the control treatment at 20\u00b0C.\n\n**Discussion:**\n\nThe findings of this study are consistent with previous research, which has reported that optimal growth rate is achieved at 25\u00b0C, while the highest yield is obtained at 30\u00b0C. However, the negative impact of high temperatures on wheat quality is a new finding, and further research is needed to fully understand the mechanisms underlying these effects.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, the results of this study suggest that optimal management of thermal stress is crucial for achieving high yields and quality in wheat production. The optimal growth rate and yield were achieved at 25\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C, respectively, while high temperatures negatively impacted the quality of the wheat. These findings have important implications for wheat production and suggest that careful management of thermal stress is necessary to achieve optimal results.\n\n**Critical Review:**\n\nThe study provides valuable insights into the effects of different temperatures on wheat growth, yield, and quality. However, there are some limitations and concerns that need to be addressed.\n\n1. **Control Group:** The study did not include a control group, which is a common practice in experiments. The control group would have provided a benchmark for the effects of different temperatures on wheat growth, yield, and quality.\n2. **Experimental Design:** The study used a single factor (temperature) with three levels, which may not be sufficient for fully exploring the effects of different temperatures on wheat growth, yield, and quality.\n3. **Sampling Methodology:** The study did not provide information on the sampling methodology used, which may have impacted the accuracy of the results.\n4. **Replication:** The study had a limited replication, with only three replicates per treatment.

        "title": "REWARD MODEL ENSEMBLES HELP MITIGATE OVEROPTIMIZATION",
        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a standard approach for fine-tuning large language models to follow instructions. As part of this process, learned reward models are used to approximately model human preferences. However, as imperfect representations of the \u201ctrue\u201d reward, these learned reward models are susceptible to overoptimization. Gao et al. (2023) studied this phenomenon in a synthetic human feedback setup with a significantly larger \u201cgold\u201d reward model acting as the true reward (instead of humans) and showed that overoptimization remains a persistent problem regardless of the size of the proxy reward model and training data used. Using a similar setup, we conduct a systematic study to evaluate the efficacy of using ensemble-based conservative optimization objectives, specifically worst-case optimization (WCO) and uncertainty-weighted optimization (UWO), for mitigating reward model overoptimization when using two optimization methods: (a) best-of-n sampling (BoN) (b) proximal policy optimization (PPO). We additionally extend the setup of Gao et al. (2023) to include 25% label noise to better mirror real-world conditions. Both with and without label noise, we find that conservative optimization practically eliminates overoptimization and improves performance by up to 70% for BoN sampling. For PPO, ensemble-based conservative optimization always reduces overoptimization and outperforms single reward model optimization. Moreover, combining it with a small KL penalty successfully prevents overoptimization at no performance cost. Overall, our results demonstrate that ensemble-based conservative optimization can effectively counter overoptimization.",

        "title": "MULTILINGUAL JAILBREAK CHALLENGES IN LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS",
        "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, they pose potential safety concerns, such as the \u201cjailbreak\u201d problem, wherein malicious instructions can manipulate LLMs to exhibit undesirable behavior. Although several preventive measures have been developed to mitigate the potential risks associated with LLMs, they have primarily focused on English. In this study, we reveal the presence of multilingual jailbreak challenges within LLMs and consider two potential risky scenarios: unintentional and intentional. The unintentional scenario involves users querying LLMs using non-English prompts and inadvertently bypassing the safety mechanisms, while the intentional scenario concerns malicious users combining malicious instructions with multilingual prompts to deliberately attack LLMs. The experimental results reveal that in the unintentional scenario, the rate of unsafe content increases as the availability of languages decreases. Specifically, low-resource languages exhibit about three times the likelihood of encountering harmful content compared to high-resource languages, with both ChatGPT and GPT-4. In the intentional scenario, multilingual prompts can exacerbate the negative impact of malicious instructions, with astonishingly high rates of unsafe output: 80.92% for ChatGPT and 40.71% for GPT-4. To handle such a challenge in the multilingual context, we propose a novel SELF-DEFENSE framework that automatically generates multilingual training data for safety fine-tuning. Experimental results show that ChatGPT fine-tuned with such data can achieve a substantial reduction in unsafe content generation. Data is available at https: //github.com/DAMO-NLP-SG/multilingual-safety-for-LLMs. Warning: this paper contains examples with unsafe content.",

The authors propose a combination of two existing medications, namely, memantine and rivastigmine, to target the underlying inflammatory pathways in the brain. The study uses a preclinical model of Alzheimer's disease and evaluates the efficacy and safety of the proposed combination therapy. The results show that the combination therapy significantly reduces neuroinflammation and improves cognitive function in the preclinical model. The authors also discuss the potential advantages of the proposed approach, including its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and ease of administration. However, the study has several limitations, including the use of a preclinical model and the lack of long-term follow-up data. \n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Overall Impression:** The study presents a well-structured and well-written proposal for a new therapeutic approach for treating neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. The authors provide a clear and concise summary of their research, highlighting the potential benefits and limitations of their approach. However, the study's limitations, particularly the use of a preclinical model, need to be addressed to strengthen the validity of the results.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n* The study provides a clear and concise summary of the proposed therapeutic approach, highlighting its potential benefits and limitations.\n* The authors use a preclinical model to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the proposed combination therapy, which is a common approach in the field of neuroinflammation research.\n* The study discusses the potential advantages of the proposed approach, including its simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and ease of administration, which may make it more appealing to clinicians and patients.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n* The study relies heavily on a preclinical model, which may not accurately translate to human clinical trials.\n* The lack of long-term follow-up data is a significant limitation, and it is unclear whether the proposed combination therapy would be effective in the long-term.\n* The study does not provide a clear explanation of the underlying mechanisms of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease, which may limit the understanding of the proposed therapeutic approach.\n* The authors may have been overly optimistic in their assessment of the proposed approach, given the complexity of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease and the limited understanding of its underlying mechanisms.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n* The authors should consider using a more robust and translational preclinical model that can better mimic the human disease.\n* Long-term follow-up data should be collected to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the proposed combination therapy in a more comprehensive manner.\n* The authors should provide a more detailed explanation of the underlying mechanisms of neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease, which would help to strengthen the validity of their results.\n* The authors may want to consider conducting a larger and more rigorous clinical trial to evaluate the efficacy and safety of the proposed combination therapy in human patients with Alzheimer's disease.\n\n**Rating:** 7/10\n\n**Conclusion:** The study presents a well-structured and well-written proposal for a new therapeutic approach for treating neuroinflammation in Alzheimer's disease. However, the study's limitations, particularly the use of a preclinical model and the lack of long-term follow-up data, need to be addressed to strengthen the validity of the results. With further improvements and a more comprehensive approach, this study has the potential to contribute meaningfully to the field of neuroinflammation research and the development of new therapeutic approaches for Alzheimer's disease.",

        "abstract": "Split conformal prediction has recently sparked great interest due to its ability to provide formally guaranteed uncertainty sets or intervals for predictions made by black-box neural models, ensuring a predefined probability of containing the actual ground truth. While the original formulation assumes data exchangeability, some extensions handle non-exchangeable data, which is often the case in many real-world scenarios. In parallel, some progress has been made in conformal methods that provide statistical guarantees for a broader range of objectives, such as bounding the best F1-score or minimizing the false negative rate in expectation. In this paper, we leverage and extend these two lines of work by proposing nonexchangeable conformal risk control, which allows controlling the expected value of any monotone loss function when the data is not exchangeable. Our framework is flexible, makes very few assumptions, and allows weighting the data based on its relevance for a given test example; a careful choice of weights may result in tighter bounds, making our framework useful in the presence of change points, time series, or other forms of distribution drift. Experiments with both synthetic and real world data show the usefulness of our method.",

        "title": "HOW CONNECTIVITY STRUCTURE SHAPES RICH AND LAZY LEARNING IN NEURAL CIRCUITS",
        "abstract": "In theoretical neuroscience, recent work leverages deep learning tools to explore how some network attributes critically influence its learning dynamics. Notably, initial weight distributions with small (resp. large) variance may yield a rich (resp. lazy) regime, where significant (resp. minor) changes to network states and representation are observed over the course of learning. However, in biology, neural circuit connectivity could exhibit a low-rank structure and therefore differs markedly from the random initializations generally used for these studies. As such, here we investigate how the structure of the initial weights \u2014 in particular their effective rank \u2014 influences the network learning regime. Through both empirical and theoretical analyses, we discover that high-rank initializations typically yield smaller network changes indicative of lazier learning, a finding we also confirm with experimentally-driven initial connectivity in recurrent neural networks. Conversely, low-rank initialization biases learning towards richer learning. Importantly, however, as an exception to this rule, we find lazier learning can still occur with a low-rank initialization that aligns with task and data statistics. Our research highlights the pivotal role of initial weight structures in shaping learning regimes, with implications for metabolic costs of plasticity and risks of catastrophic forgetting.",

        "title": "BEYOND IMITATION: LEVERAGING FINE-GRAINED QUALITY SIGNALS FOR ALIGNMENT",
        "abstract": "Alignment with human preference is a desired property of large language models (LLMs). Currently, the main alignment approach is based on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Despite the effectiveness of RLHF, it is intricate to implement and train, thus recent studies explore how to develop alternative alignment approaches based on supervised fine-tuning (SFT). A major limitation of SFT is that it essentially does imitation learning, which cannot fully understand what are the expected behaviors. To address this issue, we propose an improved alignment approach named FIGA. Different from prior methods, we incorporate fine-grained (i.e., token or phrase level) quality signals that are derived by contrasting good and bad responses. Our approach has made two major contributions. Firstly, we curate a refined alignment dataset that pairs initial responses and the corresponding revised ones. Secondly, we devise a new loss function can leverage fine-grained quality signals to instruct the learning of LLMs for alignment. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approaches by comparing a number of competitive baselines. We release all the above-mentioned resources at https://github.com/RUCAIBox/FIGA.",

        "abstract": "Online-Within-Online (OWO) meta learning stands for the online multi-task learning paradigm in which both tasks and data within each task become available in a sequential order. In this work, we study the OWO meta learning of the initialization and step size of within-task online algorithms in the non-convex setting, and provide improved regret bounds under mild assumptions of loss functions. Previous work analyzing this scenario has obtained for bounded and piecewise Lipschitz functions an averaged regret bound O(( \u221a m T 1/4 + (logm) log T \u221a T + V ) \u221a m) across T tasks, with m iterations per task and V the task similarity. Our first contribution is to modify the existing non-convex OWO meta learning algorithm and improve the regret bound to O(( 1 T 1/2\u2212\u03b1 + (log T ) 9/2 T + V ) \u221a m), for any \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1/2). The derived bound has a faster convergence rate with respect to T , and guarantees a vanishing task-averaged regret with respect to m (for any fixed T ). Then, we propose a new algorithm of regret O(( log T T + V ) \u221a m) for non-convex OWO meta learning. This regret bound exhibits a better asymptotic performance than previous ones, and holds for any bounded (not necessarily Lipschitz) loss functions. Besides the improved regret bounds, our contributions include investigating how to attain generalization bounds for statistical meta learning via regret analysis. Specifically, by online-to-batch arguments, we achieve a transfer risk bound for batch meta learning that assumes all tasks are drawn from a distribution. Moreover, by connecting multi-task generalization error with taskaveraged regret, we develop for statistical multi-task learning a novel PAC-Bayes generalization error bound that involves our regret bound for OWO meta learning.",

The authors provide a comprehensive overview of the current state of neurodegenerative diseases, the limitations of existing treatments, and the potential of nanoparticles and stem cells to address these limitations. The background section is well-researched and provides a solid foundation for the proposed therapeutic approach.\n\n**Methodology:**\nThe authors propose a multi-step approach to develop a therapeutic solution. First, they will use nanoparticles to deliver stem cells to the affected brain regions. Second, they will use stem cells to replace damaged neurons and promote neural regeneration. The third step involves using nanoparticles to deliver therapeutic proteins and genes to the brain, which will help to promote neural health and prevent disease progression. The authors also discuss the use of imaging techniques to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment.\n\n**Results:**\nThe authors present a series of promising results from preclinical trials, including improved cognitive function and reduced inflammation in animal models of neurodegenerative diseases. The results are well-presented and demonstrate the potential of the proposed therapeutic approach. However, the sample size of the preclinical trials is relatively small, and the authors do not provide sufficient information on the long-term effects of the treatment.\n\n**Conclusion and Discussion:**\nThe authors conclude that their proposed therapeutic approach holds great promise for treating neurodegenerative diseases. They discuss the potential benefits of using nanoparticles and stem cells to deliver therapeutic proteins and genes to the brain. However, they also acknowledge the challenges and limitations of the approach, including the need for further testing and validation. The discussion section is well-researched and provides a solid foundation for future studies.\n\n**Critique and Suggestions:**\nOne of the major concerns with the paper is the lack of clear evidence for the long-term effects of the treatment.

        "abstract": "Inverse problems aim to determine parameters from observations, a crucial task in engineering and science. Lately, generative models, especially diffusion models, have gained popularity in this area for their ability to produce realistic solutions and their good mathematical properties. Despite their success, an important drawback of diffusion models is their sensitivity to the choice of variance schedule, which controls the dynamics of the diffusion process. Fine-tuning this schedule for specific applications is crucial but time-consuming and does not guarantee an optimal result. We propose a novel approach for learning the schedule as part of the training process. Our method supports probabilistic conditioning on data, provides high-quality solutions, and is flexible, proving able to adapt to different applications with minimum overhead. This approach is tested in two unrelated inverse problems: super-resolution microscopy and quantitative phase imaging, yielding comparable or superior results to previous methods and fine-tuned diffusion models. We conclude that fine-tuning the schedule by experimentation should be avoided because it can be learned during training in a stable way that yields better results.

When doing so, recent studies demonstrated the importance of accounting for the symmetries and geometry of parameter spaces. However, those works developed architectures tailored to specific networks such as MLPs and CNNs without normalization layers, and generalizing such architectures to other types of networks can be challenging. In this work, we overcome these challenges by building new metanetworks \u2014 neural networks that take weights from other neural networks as input. Put simply, we carefully build graphs representing the input neural networks and process the graphs using graph neural networks. Our approach, Graph Metanetworks (GMNs), generalizes to neural architectures where competing methods struggle, such as multi-head attention layers, normalization layers, convolutional layers, ResNet blocks, and group-equivariant linear layers. We prove that GMNs are expressive and equivariant to parameter permutation symmetries that leave the input neural network functions unchanged. We validate the effectiveness of our method on several metanetwork tasks over diverse neural network architectures.",

        "abstract": "Graphic layout generation plays a significant role in user engagement and information perception. Existing methods primarily treat layout generation as a numerical optimization task, focusing on quantitative aspects while overlooking the semantic information of layout, such as the relationship between each layout element. In this paper, we propose LayoutNUWA, the first model that treats layout generation as a code generation task to enhance semantic information and harnesses the hidden layout expertise of large language models (LLMs). More concretely, we develop a Code Instruct Tuning (CIT) approach comprising three interconnected modules: 1) the Code Initialization (CI) module quantifies the numerical conditions and initializes them as HTML code with strategically placed masks; 2) the Code Completion (CC) module employs the formatting knowledge of LLMs to fill in the masked portions within the HTML code; 3) the Code Rendering (CR) module transforms the completed code into the final layout output, ensuring a highly interpretable and transparent layout generation procedure that directly maps code to a visualized layout. We attain significant state-of-the-art performance (even over 50% improvements) on multiple datasets, showcasing the strong capabilities of LayoutNUWA.

The proposed algorithm, called \"Protein-Ligand Binding Affinity Predictor (PLBA),\" is trained on a dataset of 10,000 protein-ligand complexes and achieved an accuracy of 85% on a test set of 1,000 complexes. The authors also demonstrate the effectiveness of the algorithm in predicting the binding affinity of a specific protein-ligand complex.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Overall Evaluation:** The paper presents an interesting approach to predicting protein-ligand binding affinity using deep learning techniques. However, the results and methodology require further scrutiny to determine their validity and reliability.\n\n**Methodology:** The authors use a convolutional neural network (CNN) to predict the binding affinity of protein-ligand complexes. The CNN is trained on a dataset of 10,000 protein-ligand complexes, which is relatively small compared to other datasets used in protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. The authors also use a feature extraction technique to reduce the dimensionality of the input data, which is a common approach in deep learning.\n\n**Strengths:** The authors demonstrate a good understanding of deep learning techniques and their application to protein-ligand binding affinity prediction. The proposed algorithm is also well-structured and easy to understand.\n\n**Weaknesses:** The main weakness of the paper is the small size of the training dataset, which may lead to overfitting and poor generalization performance on unseen data. The authors also do not provide a thorough analysis of the feature extraction technique used, which may affect the quality of the predictions.\n\n**Predictions:** Based on the results, I predict that the algorithm will perform well on a small test set, but its performance may degrade on a larger test set. I also predict that the authors will need to collect a larger dataset to improve the generalization performance of the algorithm.\n\n**Recommendations:** I recommend that the authors collect a larger dataset to improve the generalization performance of the algorithm. They should also provide a more detailed analysis of the feature extraction technique used and its impact on the quality of the predictions.\n\n**Future Work:** The authors should consider exploring other deep learning architectures, such as transformers or graph neural networks, to improve the performance of the algorithm. They should also investigate the use of transfer learning and domain adaptation to adapt the algorithm to different protein-ligand complexes.\n\n**Conclusion:** In conclusion, while the paper presents an interesting approach to predicting protein-ligand binding affinity using deep learning techniques, the results and methodology require further scrutiny to determine their validity and reliability. I recommend that the authors collect a larger dataset and provide a more detailed analysis of the feature extraction technique used to improve the generalization performance of the algorithm.\n\n**Rating:** 6/10\n\n**Reviewer's Signature:** [Your Name]",

        "abstract": "Knowledge distillation aims to train a compact student network using soft supervision from a larger teacher network and hard supervision from ground truths. However, determining an optimal knowledge fusion ratio that balances these supervisory signals remains challenging. Prior methods generally resort to a constant or heuristic-based fusion ratio, which often falls short of a proper balance. In this study, we introduce a novel adaptive method for learning a sample-wise knowledge fusion ratio, exploiting both the correctness of teacher and student, as well as how well the student mimics the teacher on each sample. Our method naturally leads to the intra-sample trilateral geometric relations among the student prediction (S), teacher prediction (T ), and ground truth (G). To counterbalance the impact of outliers, we further extend to the inter-sample relations, incorporating the teacher\u2019s global average prediction (T\u0304 ) for samples within the same class. A simple neural network then learns the implicit mapping from the intraand inter-sample relations to an adaptive, sample-wise knowledge fusion ratio in a bilevel-optimization manner. Our approach provides a simple, practical, and adaptable solution for knowledge distillation that can be employed across various architectures and model sizes. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over other loss re-weighting methods on image classification, attack detection, and click-through rate prediction.",

In this study, we report a novel approach using microRNA-based gene editing to treat amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) and Huntington's disease (HD). Our approach involves designing and delivering microRNA-based vectors to specific genes involved in disease pathology. We demonstrate that this approach can effectively reduce disease severity and improve motor function in animal models. Our findings have significant implications for the treatment of ALS and HD, and suggest a promising new therapeutic strategy.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nNeurodegenerative diseases, such as ALS and HD, are characterized by progressive neuronal loss and damage to specific gene regulatory pathways. Current treatments are largely symptomatic and have limited efficacy. The development of novel therapeutic strategies is therefore essential. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play a critical role in regulating gene expression. Recent advances in miRNA-based gene editing have opened up new avenues for therapeutic intervention.\n\n**Methods:**\n\nOur approach involved designing and delivering microRNA-based vectors to specific genes involved in disease pathology. We used a combination of in vitro and in vivo models, including mouse models of ALS and HD. We demonstrated that microRNA-based vectors can effectively reduce disease severity and improve motor function in animal models. We also evaluated the safety and efficacy of our approach in a series of in vitro and in vivo experiments.\n\n**Results:**\n\nOur data show that microRNA-based vectors can effectively reduce disease severity and improve motor function in animal models of ALS and HD. We observed significant reductions in disease severity and improvements in motor function in both models. We also observed significant reductions in inflammation and oxidative stress, which are key contributors to disease pathology. Our data suggest that microRNA-based vectors can be used to treat a range of neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**Discussion:**\n\nOur findings have significant implications for the treatment of ALS and HD. Our approach represents a promising new therapeutic strategy that could potentially be used to treat a range of neurodegenerative diseases. However, further research is needed to fully evaluate the efficacy and safety of our approach. We propose several potential directions for future research, including evaluation of our approach in human clinical trials.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, our study demonstrates a novel approach using microRNA-based gene editing to treat ALS and HD. Our findings suggest a promising new therapeutic strategy that could potentially be used to treat a range of neurodegenerative diseases. Further research is needed to fully evaluate the efficacy and safety of our approach.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe paper presents an interesting and promising approach to treating neurodegenerative diseases using microRNA-based gene editing. The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the underlying biology and propose a well-defined therapeutic strategy.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. The paper provides a clear and concise overview of the current state of knowledge in microRNA-based gene editing and its potential therapeutic applications.\n2. The authors demonstrate a thorough understanding of the underlying biology of ALS and HD, and propose a well-defined therapeutic strategy.\n3. The paper includes a range of in vitro and in vivo experiments to support their findings, providing a strong foundation for their conclusions.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. The paper lacks a clear discussion of potential off-target effects and unintended consequences of using microRNA-based vectors.\n2. The authors assume that their approach is suitable for a range of neurodegenerative diseases without providing sufficient evidence to support this claim.\n3. The paper could benefit from a more detailed discussion of potential challenges and limitations of their approach.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nBased on our review, we recommend that the authors address the following:\n\n1. Provide a more detailed discussion of potential off-target effects and unintended consequences of using microRNA-based vectors.\n2. Evaluate their approach in a range of animal models to ensure its applicability to different diseases.\n3. Discuss potential challenges and limitations of their approach, including potential difficulties in delivering microRNA-based vectors to specific genes.\n\n**Rating:**\n\nWe give this paper a rating of 8 out of 10. The authors have made a significant contribution to our understanding of microRNA-based gene editing and its potential therapeutic applications. However, further research is needed to fully evaluate the efficacy and safety of their approach.\n\n**Future Directions:**\n\nWe believe that this paper represents a promising new therapeutic strategy that could potentially be used to treat a range of neurodegenerative diseases. Further research is needed to fully evaluate its efficacy and safety, and to address potential challenges and limitations. We propose several potential directions for future research, including:\n\n1. Evaluation of microRNA-based vectors in human clinical trials.\n2. Investigation of potential off-target effects and unintended consequences of using microRNA-based vectors.\n3. Development of novel delivery systems to improve the efficacy and safety of microRNA-based vectors.\n\nOverall, we believe that this paper represents an important contribution to our understanding of microRNA-based gene editing and its potential therapeutic applications.",

The proposed strategy involves the use of a combination of RNA interference (RNAi) and small-molecule inhibitors to target the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). The authors demonstrate that this approach is effective in preventing the accumulation of misfolded proteins and promoting the clearance of damaged motor neurons in a mouse model of ALS. The results suggest that this therapeutic strategy may be a valuable addition to existing treatments for ALS.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Overall Impression:**\nThe paper presents an interesting and innovative approach to the treatment of ALS, a devastating neurodegenerative disease. The authors' use of RNAi and small-molecule inhibitors to target the UPS is a novel strategy that warrants further investigation.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. The authors' use of a mouse model of ALS is a significant strength, as it provides a relevant and controlled system for studying the effects of their therapeutic strategy.\n2. The proposed approach is based on a well-understood mechanism of protein clearance, and the authors provide a thorough review of the relevant literature.\n3. The results demonstrate a significant reduction in misfolded protein accumulation and motor neuron damage, which is a critical outcome for ALS treatment.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. The study's sample size is relatively small, which may limit the generalizability of the results to humans.\n2.

        "abstract": "Graph-based semi-supervised learning, particularly in the context of extremely sparse labeled data, often suffers from degenerate solutions where label functions tend to be nearly constant across unlabeled data. In this paper, we introduce Variance-enlarged Poisson Learning (VPL), a simple yet powerful framework tailored to alleviate the issues arising from the presence of degenerate solutions. VPL incorporates a variance-enlarged regularization term, which induces a Poisson equation specifically for unlabeled data. This intuitive approach increases the dispersion of labels from their average mean, effectively reducing the likelihood of degenerate solutions characterized by nearly constant label functions. We subsequently introduce two streamlined algorithms, V-Laplace and V-Poisson, each intricately designed to enhance Laplace and Poisson learning, respectively. Furthermore, we broaden the scope of VPL to encompass graph neural networks, introducing Variance-enlarged Graph Poisson Networks (V-GPN) to facilitate improved label propagation. To achieve a deeper understanding of VPL\u2019s behavior, we conduct a comprehensive theoretical exploration in both discrete and variational cases. Our findings elucidate that VPL inherently amplifies the importance of connections within the same class while concurrently tempering those between different classes. We support our claims with extensive experiments, demonstrating the effectiveness of VPL and showcasing its superiority over existing methods.

        "abstract": "Previous literature on policy diversity in reinforcement learning (RL) either focuses on the online setting or ignores the policy performance. In contrast, offline RL, which aims to learn high-quality policies from batched data, has yet to fully leverage the intrinsic diversity of the offline dataset. Addressing this dichotomy and aiming to balance quality and diversity poses a significant challenge to extant methodologies. This paper introduces a novel approach, termed Stylized Offline RL (SORL), which is designed to extract high-performing, stylistically diverse policies from a dataset characterized by distinct behavioral patterns. Drawing inspiration from the venerable Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, SORL innovatively alternates between policy learning and trajectory clustering, a mechanism that promotes policy diversification. To further augment policy performance, we introduce advantage-weighted style learning into the SORL framework. Experimental evaluations across multiple environments demonstrate the significant superiority of SORL over previous methods in extracting high-quality policies with diverse behaviors. A case in point is that SORL successfully learns strong policies with markedly distinct playing patterns from a real-world human dataset of a popular basketball video game \u201dDunk City Dynasty.\u201d",

The impact of temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality has been a subject of extensive research. In this study, we investigated the effects of different temperature regimes (optimal, mild, and extreme) on the yield and quality of wheat. Our results show that optimal temperature (15-25\u00b0C) and mild temperature (10-15\u00b0C) regimes resulted in higher yield and better quality wheat, while extreme temperature regimes (5-10\u00b0C and 25-30\u00b0C) led to reduced yield and lower quality wheat. Our findings suggest that maintaining optimal temperature regimes is crucial for ensuring the yield and quality of wheat crops. \n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe paper provides an interesting exploration of the impact of temperature regimes on the yield and quality of wheat. The study's findings align with previous research on the topic, and the results are presented in a clear and concise manner. However, the study's scope and methodology could be expanded and strengthened to provide more comprehensive insights into the effects of temperature regimes on wheat crops.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. **Clear objectives and methodology:** The study's objectives and methodology are well-defined, and the experimental design is straightforward. The use of a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three temperature regimes is a good choice for assessing the effects of temperature on wheat yield and quality.\n2. **Data analysis:** The data analysis is thorough, and the results are presented in a clear and concise manner. The use of statistical models, such as analysis of variance (ANOVA) and regression analysis, is appropriate for assessing the effects of temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality.\n3. **Results interpretation:** The results are well-interpreted, and the conclusions drawn from the data are logical and supported by the findings. The study's findings align with previous research on the topic, and the results provide valuable insights into the effects of temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Limited scope:** The study's scope is relatively narrow, focusing on the effects of temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality. Expanding the study's scope to include other factors that may affect wheat yield and quality, such as moisture content, soil type, and pest management, could provide more comprehensive insights into the topic.\n2. **Small sample size:** The study's small sample size (n = 3) may not be representative of the entire population of wheat crops. Increasing the sample size could provide more reliable and generalizable results.\n3. **Lack of replication:** The study's results are not replicated, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Replicating the study's findings in multiple locations and under different conditions could provide more robust and reliable results.\n4. **Limited discussion of variability:** The study's results are presented in a relatively straightforward manner, without much discussion of the variability associated with the data. Discussing the variability in the data could provide more insight into the study's findings and help to identify any sources of error or bias.\n5. **Lack of comparison with existing literature:** The study's results are not directly comparable to existing literature on the topic. Comparing the study's findings with existing literature could provide more context and help to identify any gaps or inconsistencies in the current understanding of the topic.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Expand the study's scope:** Consider expanding the study's scope to include other factors that may affect wheat yield and quality, such as moisture content, soil type, and pest management.\n2. **Increase the sample size:** Consider increasing the sample size to provide more reliable and generalizable results.\n3. **Replicate the study:** Consider replicating the study's findings in multiple locations and under different conditions to provide more robust and reliable results.\n4. **Discuss variability:** Consider discussing the variability associated with the data to provide more insight into the study's findings and help to identify any sources of error or bias.\n5. **Compare with existing literature:** Consider comparing the study's findings with existing literature on the topic to provide more context and help to identify any gaps or inconsistencies in the current understanding of the topic.\n6. **Consider using more advanced statistical models:** Consider using more advanced statistical models, such as machine learning algorithms or Bayesian analysis, to provide more nuanced and detailed insights into the effects of temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality.\n7. **Consider incorporating more variables:** Consider incorporating more variables, such as weather patterns, soil type, and pest management, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the effects of temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality.",

While ViTs use computationally expensive self-attention operations in every layer, we identify that these operations are highly correlated across layers \u2013 a key redundancy that causes unnecessary computations. Based on this observation, we propose SKIPAT, a method to reuse self-attention computation from preceding layers to approximate attention at one or more subsequent layers. To ensure that reusing self-attention blocks across layers does not degrade the performance, we introduce a simple parametric function, which outperforms the baseline transformer\u2019s performance while running computationally faster. We show that SKIPAT is agnostic to transformer architecture and is effective in image classification, semantic segmentation, image denoising, and video denoising. We achieve improved throughput at the same-or-higher accuracy levels in all these tasks.",

We introduce a SSL model that leverages a hierarchical Transformer architecture, complemented by HuBERT-style masked prediction objectives, to process speech at multiple resolutions. Experimental results indicate that the proposed model not only achieves more efficient inference but also exhibits superior or comparable performance to the original HuBERT model over various tasks. Specifically, significant performance improvements over the original HuBERT have been observed in fine-tuning experiments on the LibriSpeech speech recognition benchmark as well as in evaluations using the Speech Universal PERformance Benchmark (SUPERB) and Multilingual SUPERB (ML-SUPERB).",

This method constructs a smoothed DNN model and certifies its robustness through statistical sampling, but it is computationally expensive, especially when certifying with a large number of samples. Furthermore, when the smoothed model is modified (e.g., quantized or pruned), certification guarantees may not hold for the modified DNN, and recertifying from scratch can be prohibitively expensive. We present the first approach for incremental robustness certification for randomized smoothing, IRS. We show how to reuse the certification guarantees for the original smoothed model to certify an approximated model with very few samples. IRS significantly reduces the computational cost of certifying modified DNNs while maintaining strong robustness guarantees. We experimentally demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach, showing up to 4.1x certification speedup over the certification that applies randomized smoothing of approximate model from scratch.",

The authors demonstrate a clear understanding of the subject matter and present a well-structured argument. However, the manuscript requires significant revisions to improve its overall quality, clarity, and validity.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. The authors provide a thorough literature review, highlighting the limitations of existing methods and the need for novel approaches.\n2. The proposed algorithm, \"DeepBind,\" is well-defined and well-explained, with clear descriptions of its architecture and training procedures.\n3. The authors demonstrate a good understanding of the biological context, including the importance of binding affinity and the role of ligands in protein function.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Methodology:** The DeepBind algorithm is trained on a relatively small dataset (N = 1000), which may not be sufficient to capture the complexities of protein-ligand interactions. The authors should consider using larger, more diverse datasets to improve the algorithm's generalizability.\n2. **Validation:** The authors rely on a single validation metric (RMSD) to evaluate the performance of DeepBind. This may not be sufficient to capture the nuances of binding affinity, which can be affected by multiple factors, including ligand conformation, binding site flexibility, and solvent effects. The authors should consider using multiple validation metrics, such as binding free energy or docking scores.\n3. **Biological Relevance:** While the authors provide some biological context, they fail to discuss the implications of their results in terms of biological significance. For example, how do the predicted binding affinities relate to known biological processes or disease mechanisms? What are the potential consequences of using DeepBind to predict binding affinities in real-world applications?\n4. **Computational Resources:** The authors do not provide any details on the computational resources used to train and evaluate DeepBind. This makes it difficult to assess the scalability and efficiency of the algorithm. The authors should provide more information on the computational resources used and discuss the implications for real-world deployment.\n5. **Ethical Considerations:** The authors do not discuss any ethical considerations related to the use of DeepBind to predict binding affinities. For example, how might the algorithm be used to predict binding affinities for small molecules that may be used in drug development? What are the potential risks or consequences of using such an algorithm?\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Data:** Collect and preprocess a larger, more diverse dataset to improve the generalizability of DeepBind.\n2. **Validation:** Use multiple validation metrics to capture the nuances of binding affinity.\n3. **Biological Relevance:** Discuss the implications of the results in terms of biological significance and provide examples of how DeepBind can be used to predict binding affinities in real-world applications.\n4. **Computational Resources:** Provide more information on the computational resources used to train and evaluate DeepBind and discuss the implications for real-world deployment.\n5. **Ethical Considerations:** Discuss the ethical implications of using DeepBind to predict binding affinities and provide guidance on responsible use.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe paper presents an innovative approach to predicting protein-ligand binding affinity using deep learning techniques. While the manuscript requires significant revisions to improve its overall quality, clarity, and validity, it has the potential to contribute meaningfully to the field of bioinformatics and computational biology. With careful revisions and attention to the recommendations outlined above, the authors can strengthen their manuscript and make a more significant impact on the field.",

Recent studies have shown its ability to counteract backdoor risks present in original training samples. In this study, we delve into the theoretical aspects of backdoor attacks and dataset distillation based on kernel methods. We introduce two new theory-driven trigger pattern generation methods specialized for dataset distillation. Following a comprehensive set of analyses and experiments, we show that our optimization-based trigger design framework informs effective backdoor attacks on dataset distillation. Notably, datasets poisoned by our designed trigger prove resilient against conventional backdoor attack detection and mitigation methods.

        "abstract": "The fluency and creativity of large pre-trained language models (LLMs) have led to their widespread use, sometimes even as a replacement for traditional search engines. Yet language models are prone to making convincing but factually inaccurate claims, often referred to as \u2018hallucinations.\u2019 These errors can inadvertently spread misinformation or harmfully perpetuate misconceptions. Further, manual fact-checking of model responses is a time-consuming process, making human factuality labels expensive to acquire. In this work, we fine-tune language models to be more factual, without human labeling and targeting more open-ended generation settings than past work. We leverage two key recent innovations in NLP to do so. First, several recent works have proposed methods for judging the factuality of open-ended text by measuring consistency with an external knowledge base or simply a large model\u2019s confidence scores. Second, the direct preference optimization algorithm enables straightforward fine-tuning of language models on objectives other than supervised imitation, using a preference ranking over possible model responses. We show that learning from automatically generated factuality preference rankings, generated either through existing retrieval systems or our novel retrieval-free approach, significantly improves the factuality (percent of generated claims that are correct) of Llama-2 on held-out topics compared with RLHF or decoding strategies targeted at factuality. At 7B scale, compared to Llama-2-chat, we observe 58% and 40% reduction in factual error rate when generating biographies and answering medical questions, respectively.",

The authors conducted a comprehensive literature review of 50 empirical studies published between 2000 and 2020, focusing on the impacts of rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events on crop yields, agricultural productivity, and food availability. The study found that:\n\n* Rising temperatures are expected to reduce crop yields by 10-20% by 2050, with significant regional variations in impact depending on factors such as latitude, altitude, and agricultural practices.\n* Changes in precipitation patterns are projected to lead to crop failures in 20-30% of global agricultural regions by 2100, with increased frequency of droughts and floods exacerbating existing vulnerabilities in agricultural systems.\n* Increased frequency of extreme weather events, such as heatwaves and heavy rainfall, is expected to lead to significant economic and social impacts on farmers, particularly in developing countries.\n\nThe authors also highlight the need for adaptive management strategies, such as agroforestry, conservation agriculture, and crop diversity, to enhance resilience to climate change impacts on agriculture. They emphasize that policy-makers and practitioners must prioritize investments in agricultural research and development, as well as capacity-building and support for smallholder farmers, to address the looming challenges to global food security.\n\nPeer Review:\n\nTitle: Investigating the Effects of Climate Change on Global Food Security: A Review of Empirical Studies\n\nThe paper presents a comprehensive and systematic literature review of empirical studies on the impacts of climate change on global food security. The authors' use of a wide range of data sources, including peer-reviewed articles, conference proceedings, and grey literature, ensures that their analysis is robust and representative of the current state of knowledge in this area.\n\nStrengths:\n\n* The paper provides a clear and concise overview of the current state of knowledge on the impacts of climate change on agriculture, highlighting key findings and implications for policy and practice.\n* The authors' use of a systematic literature review approach ensures that their analysis is rigorous and transparent, allowing readers to evaluate their conclusions with confidence.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n* The paper's focus on empirical evidence may limit its applicability to non-research contexts, such as policy-making and advocacy. While empirical evidence is essential for informing decision-making, it is not always possible to apply it directly to real-world scenarios without further analysis and interpretation.\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n\n* The authors could benefit from incorporating case-study analyses or real-world applications of their findings to illustrate their implications for policy and practice. This would help to demonstrate the practical relevance of their conclusions and provide a more nuanced understanding of their implications.\n\n* The paper could also benefit from a more critical evaluation of existing literature on this topic. While the authors provide a comprehensive literature review, they do not engage in a critical analysis of their findings or evaluate the limitations and biases of existing empirical evidence. A more critical approach would strengthen their conclusions and provide a deeper understanding of the complexities of this issue.\n\n* The authors' emphasis on adaptive management strategies, such as agroforestry and conservation agriculture, is timely and important. However, they could benefit from exploring alternative approaches, such as integrated pest management or crop rotation, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of their implications for agricultural resilience.\n\nOverall, this paper provides a valuable contribution to our understanding of the impacts of climate change on global food security. While it has some limitations, its comprehensive and systematic literature review, clear and concise presentation, and emphasis on practical implications make it an important resource for researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers.\n\nRecommendation:\nI recommend that this paper be published in a peer-reviewed journal, subject to minor revisions addressing some of the suggestions outlined above. The authors' contributions to our understanding of this critical issue are significant, and their emphasis on practical implications and adaptive management strategies make their paper a valuable resource for stakeholders in this area.",

        "abstract": "We introduce a novel generative modeling framework grounded in phase space dynamics, taking inspiration from the principles underlying Critically damped Langevin Dynamics and Bridge Matching. Leveraging insights from Stochastic Optimal Control, we construct a more favorable path measure in the phase space that is highly advantageous for efficient sampling. A distinctive feature of our approach is the early-stage data prediction capability within the context of propagating generative Ordinary Differential Equations or Stochastic Differential Equations. This early prediction, enabled by the model\u2019s unique structural characteristics, sets the stage for more efficient data generation, leveraging additional velocity information along the trajectory. This innovation has spurred the exploration of a novel avenue for mitigating sampling complexity by quickly converging to realistic data samples. Our model yields comparable results in image generation and notably outperforms baseline methods, particularly when faced with a limited Number of Function Evaluations. Furthermore, our approach rivals the performance of diffusion models equipped with efficient sampling techniques, underscoring its potential in the realm of generative modeling.",

        "abstract": "Data augmentation is one of the most prevalent tools in deep learning, underpinning many recent advances, including those from classification, generative models, and representation learning. The standard approach to data augmentation combines simple transformations like rotations and flips to generate new images from existing ones. However, these new images lack diversity along key semantic axes present in the data. Current augmentations cannot alter the high-level semantic attributes, such as animal species present in a scene, to enhance the diversity of data. We address the lack of diversity in data augmentation with image-to-image transformations parameterized by pre-trained text-to-image diffusion models. Our method edits images to change their semantics using an off-the-shelf diffusion model, and generalizes to novel visual concepts from a few labelled examples. We evaluate our approach on few-shot image classification tasks, and on a real-world weed recognition task, and observe an improvement in accuracy in tested domains.

Focusing on image classification, we consider the setting of a black-box transfer attack where an attacker does not know the target model. Instead of forcing corrupted image representations to cross the nearest decision boundaries or converge to a particular point, we propose a distribution-oriented approach. We rely on optimal transport to push the feature distribution of attacked images towards an already modeled distribution. We show that this new distribution-oriented approach leads to better transferable patches. Through digital experiments conducted on ImageNet-1K, we provide evidence that our new patches are the only ones that can simultaneously influence multiple Transformer models and Convolutional Neural Networks. Physical world experiments demonstrate that our patch can affect systems in deployment without explicit knowledge.",

        "abstract": "While Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used in real-world applications, they remain vulnerable to prompt injection attacks: malicious third party prompts that subvert the intent of the system designer. To help researchers study this problem, we present a dataset of over 126,000 prompt injection attacks and 46,000 prompt-based \u201cdefenses\u201d against prompt injection, all created by players of an online game called Tensor Trust. To the best of our knowledge, this is currently the largest dataset of human-generated adversarial examples for instruction-following LLMs. The attacks in our dataset have easily interpretable structure, and shed light on the weaknesses of LLMs. We also use the dataset to create a benchmark for resistance to two types of prompt injection, which we refer to as prompt extraction and prompt hijacking. Our benchmark results show that many models are vulnerable to the attack strategies in the Tensor Trust dataset. Furthermore, we show that some attack strategies from the dataset generalize to deployed LLM-based applications, even though they have a very different set of constraints to the game. We release data and code at [removed].",

        "abstract": "There is increasing interest in methods for extracting interpretable rules from ML models trained to solve a wide range of tasks over knowledge graphs (KGs), such as KG completion, node classification, question answering and recommendation. Many such approaches, however, lack formal guarantees establishing the precise relationship between the model and the extracted rules, and this lack of assurance becomes especially problematic when the extracted rules are applied in safetycritical contexts or to ensure compliance with legal requirements. Recent research has examined whether the rules derived from the influential NEURAL-LP model exhibit soundness (or completeness), which means that the results obtained by applying the model to any dataset always contain (or are contained in) the results obtained by applying the rules to the same dataset. In this paper, we extend this analysis to the context of DRUM, an approach that has demonstrated superior practical performance. After observing that the rules currently extracted from a DRUM model can be unsound and/or incomplete, we propose a novel algorithm where the output rules, expressed in an extension of Datalog, ensure both soundness and completeness. This algorithm, however, can be inefficient in practice and hence we propose additional constraints to DRUM models facilitating rule extraction, albeit at the expense of reduced expressive power.",

If the model is accurate enough, it accelerates the convergence to the true value function too. One of its key components is the MaxEnt Model Correction (MoCo) procedure that corrects the model\u2019s next-state distributions based on a Maximum Entropy density estimation formulation. Based on MoCo, we introduce the Model Correcting Value Iteration (MoCoVI) algorithm, and its sampled-based variant MoCoDyna. We show that MoCoVI and MoCoDyna\u2019s convergence can be much faster than the conventional model-free algorithms. Unlike traditional model-based algorithms, MoCoVI and MoCoDyna effectively utilize an approximate model and still converge to the correct value function.",

        "abstract": "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) stands as a cornerstone optimization algorithm with proven real-world empirical successes but relatively limited theoretical understanding. Recent research has illuminated a key factor contributing to its practical efficacy: the implicit regularization it instigates. Several studies have investigated the linear stability property of SGD in the vicinity of a stationary point as a predictive proxy for sharpness and generalization error in overparameterized neural networks (Wu et al., 2022; Jastrzebski et al., 2019; Cohen et al., 2021). In this paper, we delve deeper into the relationship between linear stability and sharpness. More specifically, we meticulously delineate the necessary and sufficient conditions for linear stability, contingent on hyperparameters of SGD and the sharpness at the optimum. Towards this end, we introduce a novel coherence measure of the loss Hessian that encapsulates pertinent geometric properties of the loss function that are relevant to the linear stability of SGD. It enables us to provide a simplified sufficient condition for identifying linear instability at an optimum. Notably, compared to previous works, our analysis relies on significantly milder assumptions and is applicable for a broader class of loss functions than known before, encompassing not only mean-squared error but also cross-entropy loss.",

Previous works have analyzed separately how forgetting is affected by either task similarity or overparameterization. In contrast, our paper examines how task similarity and overparameterization jointly affect forgetting in an analyzable model. Specifically, we focus on two-task continual linear regression, where the second task is a random orthogonal transformation of an arbitrary first task (an abstraction of random permutation tasks). We derive an exact analytical expression for the expected forgetting \u2014 and uncover a nuanced pattern. In highly overparameterized models, intermediate task similarity causes the most forgetting. However, near the interpolation threshold, forgetting decreases monotonically with the expected task similarity. We validate our findings with linear regression on synthetic data, and with neural networks on established permutation task benchmarks.",

        "abstract": "Supervised learning methods have been found to exhibit inductive biases favoring simpler features. When such features are spuriously correlated with the label, this can result in suboptimal performance on minority subgroups. Despite the growing popularity of methods which learn from unlabeled data, the extent to which these representations rely on spurious features for prediction is unclear. In this work, we explore the impact of spurious features on Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for visual representation learning. We first empirically show that commonly used augmentations in SSL can cause undesired invariances in the image space, and illustrate this with a simple example. We further show that classical approaches in combating spurious correlations, such as dataset re-sampling during SSL, do not consistently lead to invariant representations. Motivated by these findings, we propose LATETVG to remove spurious information from these representations during pretraining, by regularizing later layers of the encoder via pruning. We find that our method produces representations which outperform the baselines on several benchmarks, without the need for group or label information during SSL.",

        "abstract": "Text generation under constraints have seen increasing interests in natural language processing, especially with the rapidly improving capabilities of large language models. However, existing benchmarks for constrained generation usually focus on fixed constraint types (e.g. generate a sentence containing certain words) that have proved to be easy for state-of-the-art models like GPT-4. We present COLLIE, a grammar-based framework that allows the specification of rich, compositional constraints with diverse generation levels (word, sentence, paragraph, passage) and modeling challenges (e.g. language understanding, logical reasoning, counting, semantic planning). We also develop tools for automatic extraction of task instances given a constraint structure and a raw text corpus. Using COLLIE, we compile the COLLIE-v1 dataset with 2,080 instances comprising 13 constraint structures. We perform systematic experiments across five state-of-the-art instruction-tuned language models and analyze their performances to reveal shortcomings. COLLIE is designed to be extensible and lightweight, and we hope the community finds it useful to develop more complex constraints and evaluations in the future.",

The research team, led by Dr. Maria Rodriguez, used a combination of statistical models and machine learning algorithms to analyze large-scale datasets from various sources, including the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) and the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP). The study focused on the effects of climate change on species extinction, habitat fragmentation, and ecosystem disruption.\n\nThe paper begins by providing an introduction to the topic, highlighting the alarming rate of species extinction and the critical role of climate change in exacerbating this trend. The authors then describe the methodology used to collect and analyze the data, which included the use of machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and trends in the data.\n\nThe results section presents the findings of the study, which indicate a strong correlation between climate change and species extinction. The study also found that habitat fragmentation and ecosystem disruption are critical drivers of biodiversity loss, particularly in tropical regions. The authors suggest that these findings have important implications for conservation and management strategies.\n\nThe discussion section provides an in-depth analysis of the results, highlighting the limitations and potential biases of the study. The authors also discuss the potential consequences of inaction, including the potential for catastrophic losses in biodiversity.\n\nThe conclusion section summarizes the main findings of the study and highlights the importance of addressing the root causes of climate change to prevent further biodiversity losses.\n\n**Peer Review**\n\nOverall, the paper presents a thorough and well-structured analysis of the impact of climate change on global biodiversity. The use of machine learning algorithms to analyze large-scale datasets adds a valuable layer of complexity to the study, and the results are well-supported by the data.\n\nHowever, there are several areas that require improvement. Firstly, the paper could benefit from a more detailed description of the data sources and the data quality control procedures used to ensure the reliability of the results. The use of machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and trends in the data also raises questions about the potential for bias and overfitting.\n\nFurthermore, the study could have been strengthened by the inclusion of more nuanced and context-specific analyses of the results. For example, the paper could have explored the differences in biodiversity responses to climate change in different regions and ecosystems, or examined the potential impacts of climate change on specific species and habitats.\n\nAdditionally, the paper could have been improved by the inclusion of more robust and comprehensive conservation strategies. The study highlights the importance of addressing the root causes of climate change, but it does not provide a detailed outline of the practical steps that can be taken to mitigate these impacts.\n\nIn terms of methodology, the paper could have been strengthened by the inclusion of more detailed descriptions of the machine learning algorithms used and the data preprocessing techniques employed. The use of machine learning algorithms to analyze large-scale datasets also raises questions about the potential for computational complexity and scalability.\n\nFinally, the paper could have been improved by the inclusion of more rigorous testing and validation procedures to ensure the reliability and generalizability of the results. The use of machine learning algorithms to identify patterns and trends in the data also raises questions about the potential for overfitting and bias.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nBased on the peer review, I would recommend the following:\n\n* The paper should be revised to include more detailed descriptions of the data sources and data quality control procedures used to ensure the reliability of the results.\n* The use of machine learning algorithms to analyze large-scale datasets should be reevaluated, and the potential for bias and overfitting should be addressed.\n* The study could be strengthened by the inclusion of more nuanced and context-specific analyses of the results, such as regional and ecosystem-specific analyses.\n* The paper should be revised to include more comprehensive conservation strategies and practical steps that can be taken to mitigate the impacts of climate change.\n* The use of machine learning algorithms should be accompanied by more rigorous testing and validation procedures to ensure the reliability and generalizability of the results.\n\n**Rating**\n\nBased on the peer review, I would give this paper a rating of 7 out of 10. The paper presents a thorough and well-structured analysis of the impact of climate change on global biodiversity, and the use of machine learning algorithms adds a valuable layer of complexity to the study. However, the paper could benefit from several revisions to strengthen the methodology, analysis, and conservation strategies.",

The motivation of this problem is to learn a structured and plannable state and action space.

In this work, we point out that State CHangEs MAtter (SCHEMA) for procedure planning in instructional videos. We aim to establish a more structured state space by investigating the causal relations between steps and states in procedures. Specifically, we explicitly represent each step as state changes and track the state changes in procedures. For step representation, we leveraged the commonsense knowledge in large language models (LLMs) to describe the state changes of steps via our designed chain-of-thought prompting. For state change tracking, we align visual state observations with language state descriptions via cross-modal contrastive learning, and explicitly model the intermediate states of the procedure using LLM-generated state descriptions. Experiments on CrossTask, COIN, and NIV benchmark datasets demonstrate that our proposed SCHEMA model achieves state-of-the-art performance and obtains explainable visualizations.",

        "abstract": "We propose a novel random walk-based algorithm for unbiased estimation of arbitrary functions of a weighted adjacency matrix, coined general graph random features (g-GRFs). This includes many of the most popular examples of kernels defined on the nodes of a graph. Our algorithm enjoys subquadratic time complexity with respect to the number of nodes, overcoming the notoriously prohibitive cubic scaling of exact graph kernel evaluation. It can also be trivially distributed across machines, permitting learning on much larger networks. At the heart of the algorithm is a modulation function which upweights or downweights the contribution from di erent random walks depending on their lengths. We show that by parameterising it with a neural network we can obtain g-GRFs that give higher-quality kernel estimates or perform e cient, scalable kernel learning. We provide robust theoretical analysis and support our findings with experiments including pointwise estimation of fixed graph kernels, solving non-homogeneous graph ordinary di erential equations, node clustering and kernel regression on triangular meshes.1",

        "abstract": "Proximal causal learning is a powerful framework for identifying the causal effect under the existence of unmeasured confounders. Within this framework, the doubly robust (DR) estimator was derived and has shown its effectiveness in estimation, especially when the model assumption is violated. However, the current form of the DR estimator is restricted to binary treatments, while the treatments can be continuous in many real-world applications. The primary obstacle to continuous treatments resides in the delta function present in the original DR estimator, making it infeasible in causal effect estimation and introducing a heavy computational burden in nuisance function estimation. To address these challenges, we propose a kernel-based DR estimator that can well handle continuous treatments for proximal causal learning. Equipped with its smoothness, we show that its oracle form is a consistent approximation of the influence function. Further, we propose a new approach to efficiently solve the nuisance functions. We then provide a comprehensive convergence analysis in terms of the mean square error. We demonstrate the utility of our estimator on synthetic datasets and real-world applications1.",

        "abstract": "Mixture models arise in many regression problems, but most methods have seen limited adoption partly due to these algorithms\u2019 highly-tailored and model-specific nature. On the other hand, transformers are flexible, neural sequence models that present the intriguing possibility of providing general-purpose prediction methods, even in this mixture setting. In this work, we investigate the hypothesis that transformers can learn an optimal predictor for mixtures of regressions. We construct a generative process for a mixture of linear regressions for which the decision-theoretic optimal procedure is given by data-driven exponential weights on a finite set of parameters. We observe that transformers achieve low meansquared error on data generated via this process. By probing the transformer\u2019s output at inference time, we also show that transformers typically make predictions that are close to the optimal predictor. Our experiments also demonstrate that transformers can learn mixtures of regressions in a sample-efficient fashion and are somewhat robust to distribution shifts. We complement our experimental observations by proving constructively that the decision-theoretic optimal procedure is indeed implementable by a transformer.",

This study aimed to investigate the effects of different temperature regimes on the yield and quality of wheat (Triticum aestivum). We conducted a greenhouse experiment where wheat was grown under three different temperature regimes: optimal (20\u00b0C), moderate (15\u00b0C), and extreme (25\u00b0C). Our results showed that the optimal temperature regime resulted in the highest yield and quality of wheat, followed by the moderate temperature regime. The extreme temperature regime resulted in the lowest yield and quality of wheat. Our findings have important implications for wheat production and suggest that optimal temperature regimes should be used to maximize wheat yield and quality.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nWheat (Triticum aestivum) is one of the most widely grown crops in the world, and it is an essential food source for millions of people. The yield and quality of wheat are affected by various environmental factors, including temperature. Temperature is a critical factor that affects wheat growth and development, and it is essential to understand how different temperature regimes affect wheat yield and quality.\n\n**Methods:**\n\nWe conducted a greenhouse experiment where wheat was grown under three different temperature regimes: optimal (20\u00b0C), moderate (15\u00b0C), and extreme (25\u00b0C). The experiment was conducted for 60 days, and the wheat plants were watered and fertilized regularly. The yield and quality of wheat were measured at the end of the experiment using the following parameters: yield per hectare, grain weight, protein content, and moisture content.\n\n**Results:**\n\nOur results showed that the optimal temperature regime resulted in the highest yield and quality of wheat, followed by the moderate temperature regime. The extreme temperature regime resulted in the lowest yield and quality of wheat. The yield per hectare was highest in the optimal temperature regime (12,000 kg/ha), followed by the moderate temperature regime (8,000 kg/ha), and the extreme temperature regime (4,000 kg/ha). The grain weight was also highest in the optimal temperature regime (35 g/kg), followed by the moderate temperature regime (30 g/kg), and the extreme temperature regime (20 g/kg). The protein content was highest in the optimal temperature regime (15%), followed by the moderate temperature regime (12%), and the extreme temperature regime (8%). The moisture content was highest in the moderate temperature regime (12%), followed by the optimal temperature regime (10%), and the extreme temperature regime (8%).\n\n**Discussion:**\n\nThe results of this study suggest that optimal temperature regimes should be used to maximize wheat yield and quality. The optimal temperature regime resulted in the highest yield and quality of wheat, which is consistent with previous studies. The moderate temperature regime also resulted in a significant yield and quality of wheat, but it was lower compared to the optimal temperature regime. The extreme temperature regime resulted in the lowest yield and quality of wheat, which is consistent with the literature.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, this study has provided evidence that different temperature regimes affect wheat yield and quality. The optimal temperature regime resulted in the highest yield and quality of wheat, followed by the moderate temperature regime. The extreme temperature regime resulted in the lowest yield and quality of wheat. These findings have important implications for wheat production and suggest that optimal temperature regimes should be used to maximize wheat yield and quality.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\nOverall, the study provides a clear and concise overview of the effects of different temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality. The methodology is straightforward, and the results are well-presented.\n\nStrengths:\n\n* The study is well-designed and well-executed, with a clear objective and a well-defined methodology.\n* The results are well-presented, and the tables and figures are clear and concise.\n* The discussion is thorough and well-supported by the results.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n* The study only investigates the effects of temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality, and does not consider other environmental factors that may affect wheat growth and development.\n* The study does not provide a detailed analysis of the physiological mechanisms underlying the effects of temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality.\n* The study does not consider the potential economic implications of using different temperature regimes for wheat production.\n\nRecommendations:\n\n* The study should consider the effects of other environmental factors, such as water availability, soil quality, and pest management, on wheat yield and quality.\n* The study should provide a detailed analysis of the physiological mechanisms underlying the effects of temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality.\n* The study should consider the potential economic implications of using different temperature regimes for wheat production.\n\n**Rating:**\n\nI would rate this study as 8/10. The study provides a clear and concise overview of the effects of different temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality, and the results are well-presented. However, the study has some limitations, such as not considering other environmental factors and not providing a detailed analysis of the physiological mechanisms underlying the effects of temperature regimes on wheat yield and quality.",

        "abstract": "Embodied AI models often employ off the shelf vision backbones like CLIP to encode their visual observations. Although such general purpose representations encode rich syntactic and semantic information about the scene, much of this information is often irrelevant to the specific task at hand. This introduces noise within the learning process and distracts the agent\u2019s focus from task-relevant visual cues. Inspired by selective attention in humans\u2014the process through which people filter their perception based on their experiences, knowledge, and the task at hand\u2014we introduce a parameter-efficient approach to filter visual stimuli for embodied AI. Our approach induces a task-conditioned bottleneck using a small learnable codebook module. This codebook is trained jointly to optimize task reward and acts as a task-conditioned selective filter over the visual observation. Our experiments showcase state-of-the-art performance for object goal navigation and object displacement across 5 benchmarks, ProcTHOR, ArchitecTHOR, RoboTHOR, AI2-iTHOR, and ManipulaTHOR. The filtered representations produced by the codebook are also able generalize better and converge faster when adapted to other simulation environments such as Habitat. Our qualitative analyses show that agents explore their environments more effectively and their representations retain task-relevant information like target object recognition while ignoring superfluous information about other objects.

        "title": "ADAMERGING: ADAPTIVE MODEL MERGING FOR MULTI-TASK LEARNING",
        "abstract": "Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to empower a model to tackle multiple tasks simultaneously. A recent development known as task arithmetic has revealed that several models, each fine-tuned for distinct tasks, can be directly merged into a single model to execute MTL without necessitating a retraining process using the initial training data. Nevertheless, this direct addition of models often leads to a significant deterioration in the overall performance of the merged model. This decline occurs due to potential conflicts and intricate correlations among the multiple tasks. Consequently, the challenge emerges of how to merge pre-trained models more effectively without using their original training data. This paper introduces an innovative technique called Adaptive Model Merging (AdaMerging). This approach aims to autonomously learn the coefficients for model merging, either in a task-wise or layer-wise manner, without relying on the original training data. Specifically, our AdaMerging method operates as an automatic, unsupervised task arithmetic scheme. It leverages entropy minimization on unlabeled test samples from the multi-task setup as a surrogate objective function to iteratively refine the merging coefficients of the multiple models. Our experimental findings across eight tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the AdaMerging scheme we put forth. Compared to the current state-of-the-art task arithmetic merging scheme, AdaMerging showcases a remarkable 11% improvement in performance. Notably, AdaMerging also exhibits superior generalization capabilities when applied to unseen downstream tasks. Furthermore, it displays a significantly enhanced robustness to data distribution shifts that may occur during the testing phase. The code is available at AdaMerging.",

The researchers conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial involving 30 participants with ASD. The participants were administered the novel compound or a placebo for six weeks. Anxiety levels were measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) before, during, and after treatment. The results showed a significant reduction in anxiety levels in the treatment group compared to the placebo group.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. The study design was well-conducted, with a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, which is a gold standard for evaluating the efficacy of a new treatment.\n2. The sample size was adequate, with 30 participants, which is sufficient for a pilot study.\n3. The use of the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) to measure anxiety levels is a valid and reliable tool.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. The study had a relatively small sample size, which may limit the generalizability of the results to the larger population of individuals with ASD.\n2. The study only included individuals with mild to moderate anxiety, which may not be representative of individuals with more severe anxiety symptoms.\n3. The study did not provide any information on potential side effects or long-term effects of the novel compound.\n4. The study did not include any controls for potential confounding variables, such as comorbidities or medication use.\n5. The study did not provide any information on the dosage or administration of the novel compound, which may impact its efficacy.\n\n**Methodology:**\n\n1. The study used a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled design, which is a good choice for evaluating the efficacy of a new treatment.\n2. The use of the SRS to measure anxiety levels is a valid and reliable tool.\n3. However, the study did not provide any information on the inclusion/exclusion criteria for the participants, which may impact the validity of the results.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nBased on the results of this study, it appears that the novel compound may be effective in reducing anxiety in individuals with mild to moderate anxiety symptoms. However, the results should be interpreted with caution due to the limitations of the study. Further studies with larger sample sizes, more diverse populations, and longer treatment durations are necessary to confirm the efficacy of the novel compound.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. The authors should consider conducting a larger, multicenter trial to confirm the efficacy of the novel compound.\n2. The authors should consider including a longer treatment duration to assess the long-term effects of the novel compound.\n3. The authors should consider including controls for potential confounding variables, such as comorbidities or medication use.\n4.

        "abstract": "The ability to engineer novel proteins with higher fitness for a desired property would be revolutionary for biotechnology and medicine. Modeling the combinatorially large space of sequences is infeasible; prior methods often constrain optimization to a small mutational radius, but this drastically limits the design space. Instead of heuristics, we propose smoothing the fitness landscape to facilitate protein optimization. First, we formulate protein fitness as a graph signal then use Tikunov regularization to smooth the fitness landscape. We find optimizing in this smoothed landscape leads to improved performance across multiple methods in the GFP and AAV benchmarks. Second, we achieve state-of-the-art results utilizing discrete energy-based models and MCMC in the smoothed landscape. Our method, called Gibbs sampling with Graph-based Smoothing (GGS), demonstrates a unique ability to achieve 2.5 fold fitness improvement (with in-silico evaluation) over its training set. GGS demonstrates potential to optimize proteins in the limited data regime. Code: https://github.com/kirjner/GGS",

        "abstract": "Privacy amplification exploits randomness in data selection to provide tighter differential privacy (DP) guarantees. This analysis is key to DP-SGD\u2019s success in machine learning (ML), but, is not readily applicable to the newer state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. This is because these algorithms, known as DP-FTRL, use the matrix mechanism to add correlated noise instead of independent noise as in DP-SGD. In this paper, we propose \u201cMMCC\u201d, the first algorithm to analyze privacy amplification via sampling for any generic matrix mechanism. MMCC is nearly tight in that it approaches a lower bound as \u03b5\u2192 0. To analyze correlated outputs in MMCC, we prove that they can be analyzed as if they were independent, by conditioning them on prior outputs. Our \u201cconditional composition theorem\u201d has broad utility: we use it to show that the noise added to binary-tree-DP-FTRL can asymptotically match the noise added to DP-SGD with amplification. Our algorithm also has practical empirical utility. We show that amplification leads to significant improvement in the privacy/utility trade-offs for DP-FTRL style algorithms for standard benchmark tasks.",

        "abstract": "Proactive dialogues serve as a practical yet challenging dialogue problem in the era of large language models (LLMs), where the dialogue policy planning is the key to improving the proactivity of LLMs. Most existing studies enable the dialogue policy planning of LLMs using various prompting schemes or iteratively enhance this capability in handling the given case with verbal AI feedback. However, these approaches are either bounded by the policy planning capability of the frozen LLMs or hard to be transferred to new cases. In this work, we introduce a new dialogue policy planning paradigm to strategize LLMs for proactive dialogue problems with a tunable language model plug-in as a plug-and-play dialogue policy planner, named PPDPP. Specifically, we develop a novel training framework to facilitate supervised fine-tuning over available human-annotated data as well as reinforcement learning from goal-oriented AI feedback with dynamic interaction data collected by the LLM-based self-play simulation. In this manner, the LLM-powered dialogue agent can not only be generalized to different cases after the training, but also be applicable to different applications by just substituting the learned plug-in. In addition, we propose to evaluate the policy planning capability of dialogue systems under the interactive setting. Experimental results demonstrate that PPDPP consistently and substantially outperforms existing approaches on three different proactive dialogue applications, including negotiation, emotional support, and tutoring dialogues.1",

        "abstract": "Assigning importance weights to adversarial data has achieved great success in training adversarially robust networks under limited model capacity. However, existing instance-reweighted adversarial training (AT) methods heavily depend on heuristics and/or geometric interpretations to determine those importance weights, making these algorithms lack rigorous theoretical justification/guarantee. Moreover, recent research has shown that adversarial training suffers from a severe non-uniform robust performance across the training distribution, e.g., data points belonging to some classes can be much more vulnerable to adversarial attacks than others. To address both issues, in this paper, we propose a novel doubly-robust instance reweighted AT framework, which allows to obtain the importance weights via exploring distributionally robust optimization (DRO) techniques, and at the same time boosts the robustness on the most vulnerable examples. In particular, our importance weights are obtained by optimizing the KL-divergence regularized loss function, which allows us to devise new algorithms with a theoretical convergence guarantee. Experiments on standard classification datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms related state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of average robust performance, and at the same time improves the robustness against attacks on the weakest data points.

This study proposes a novel approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases using microRNA-based gene editing. We used CRISPR-Cas9 system to introduce microRNAs (miRNAs) into neurons, which can modulate the expression of target genes involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Our results show that miRNA-based gene editing can effectively reduce the expression of disease-associated genes and improve neuronal function in vitro and in vivo models. These findings suggest that microRNA-based gene editing may be a promising therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Introduction:**\nThe introduction is clear and concise, providing an overview of the importance of developing novel therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative diseases.

The authors suggest that an imbalance of the microbiome, also known as dysbiosis, contributes to the progression of these diseases. They present a series of experiments and simulations that demonstrate the potential for microbiome manipulation as a therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nThe human microbiome is a vast and complex community of microorganisms residing in various parts of the body, including the gut, skin, and respiratory tract. Recent studies have highlighted the importance of the microbiome in maintaining human health and preventing various diseases. Neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and Huntington's, are a group of progressive disorders that affect the central nervous system and are characterized by the degeneration of neurons.\n\n**Methods:**\n\nThe authors used a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments, including cell culture, animal models, and simulations, to study the relationship between the microbiome and neurodegenerative diseases. They isolated microorganisms from the gut of patients with neurodegenerative diseases and compared them with healthy individuals. They also used a combination of machine learning algorithms and statistical analysis to identify potential biomarkers for neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**Results:**\n\nThe authors found that patients with neurodegenerative diseases had a significantly different microbiome compared to healthy individuals. They identified several microorganisms that were associated with the progression of these diseases. They also found that manipulation of the microbiome, through the use of probiotics or prebiotics, could potentially prevent or slow the progression of neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**Discussion:**\n\nThe authors suggest that the microbiome may play a critical role in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. They propose that an imbalance of the microbiome, or dysbiosis, contributes to the progression of these diseases. They also suggest that microbiome manipulation, through the use of probiotics or prebiotics, could be a therapeutic strategy for neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe authors conclude that the microbiome is a critical component of human health and that an imbalance of the microbiome, or dysbiosis, may contribute to the development of neurodegenerative diseases. They propose that microbiome manipulation, through the use of probiotics or prebiotics, could be a potential therapeutic strategy for these diseases.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\nOverall, the paper presents a compelling case for the importance of the microbiome in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. The authors present a series of experiments and simulations that demonstrate the potential for microbiome manipulation as a therapeutic strategy for these diseases.\n\nHowever, there are several limitations and concerns that need to be addressed. Firstly, the study population was relatively small, and the sample size was limited. This may have introduced bias and limited the generalizability of the findings. Secondly, the authors relied heavily on in vitro and in vivo experiments, which may not fully replicate the complex dynamics of the human microbiome.\n\nFurthermore, the authors' interpretation of the data may be too simplistic. While it is clear that the microbiome is an important component of human health, the relationship between the microbiome and neurodegenerative diseases is likely to be more complex. The authors may have missed other important factors that influence the development of these diseases, such as genetic and environmental factors.\n\nAdditionally, the authors' proposal for microbiome manipulation as a therapeutic strategy is still in its early stages. While the use of probiotics and prebiotics has shown promise in various studies, more research is needed to fully understand their effects on the microbiome and the development of neurodegenerative diseases.\n\nIn conclusion, while the paper presents a compelling case for the importance of the microbiome in the development of neurodegenerative diseases, it is essential that the authors address the limitations and concerns outlined above. With further research and refinement of the methodology, the findings of this study could have a significant impact on our understanding of these diseases and the development of new therapeutic strategies.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. The authors should increase the sample size and diversity of the study population.\n2. The authors should use more robust and diverse experimental models, such as humanized mouse models or in vitro models that mimic the complex dynamics of the human microbiome.\n3. The authors should consider other important factors that influence the development of neurodegenerative diseases, such as genetic and environmental factors.\n4. The authors should conduct further research on the effects of microbiome manipulation on the development of neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**Rating:** 7/10\n\nThis peer review provides constructive criticism of the paper, highlighting both the strengths and limitations of the study. The reviewer suggests that the authors address the limitations and concerns outlined above, and with further research and refinement of the methodology, the findings of this study could have a significant impact on our understanding of neurodegenerative diseases and the development of new therapeutic strategies.",

To ensure highest quality results, we also introduce a refinement model which is used to improve the visual fidelity of samples generated by SDXL using a post-hoc image-to-image technique.

The authors employ a mixed-methods approach, combining both quantitative and qualitative data from a survey and in-depth interviews. The results suggest that excessive social media use is associated with increased symptoms of anxiety and depression, particularly among females. The authors also find that social media use can have both positive and negative effects on mental health, depending on the individual's level of social support and self-esteem.\n\n**Methodology:**\nThe authors used a survey to collect data from 500 young adults (mean age 22.5) who used social media at least once a day. The survey included measures of social media use, anxiety, depression, social support, and self-esteem. The authors also collected in-depth interviews with 20 participants to gain a deeper understanding of their experiences. The survey and interview data were analyzed using statistical software and thematic analysis.\n\n**Strengths:**\nThe paper's mixed-methods approach is a strength, as it allows the authors to explore both quantitative and qualitative data. The survey data provide a broad understanding of the relationship between social media use and mental health, while the in-depth interviews offer rich, contextual insights into individual experiences.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\nOne weakness is the relatively small sample size, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the survey instrument may not have been validated, which could affect the reliability and validity of the results. The authors also do not provide a clear distinction between the effects of social media on anxiety and depression, which may lead to confusion among readers.\n\n**Critique:**\nThe authors' conclusion that excessive social media use is associated with increased symptoms of anxiety and depression is supported by the results. However, the authors' interpretation of the findings is somewhat simplistic, as they do not consider the role of individual differences, such as personality traits or coping mechanisms, in shaping the relationship between social media use and mental health. Furthermore, the authors' suggestion that social media use can have both positive and negative effects on mental health is overly broad, as it does not take into account the context in which social media is used.\n\n**Recommendations:**\nTo strengthen the paper, the authors could:\n\n1. Increase the sample size to enhance generalizability and statistical power.\n2. Validate the survey instrument to ensure reliability and validity.\n3. Differentiate more clearly between the effects of social media on anxiety and depression, using more precise measures or statistical analyses.\n4. Consider individual differences, such as personality traits or coping mechanisms, in shaping the relationship between social media use and mental health.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nIn conclusion, the paper provides a useful exploration of the relationship between social media use and mental health in young adults. While the findings are consistent with previous research, the authors' interpretation and conclusions could be more nuanced and sophisticated. With some methodological adjustments and a more detailed analysis, the authors could strengthen the paper and provide more actionable insights into the complex relationship between social media use and mental health.\n\n**Rating:** 7/10\n\nThis review is intended to provide a constructive critique and suggestions for improvement, rather than a definitive judgment on the paper's quality. The authors have made a significant contribution to the field, and with some refinement, the paper could be even more impactful.",

        "abstract": "With advances in generative AI, there is now potential for autonomous agents to manage daily tasks via natural language commands. However, current agents are primarily created and tested in simplified synthetic environments, leading to a disconnect with real-world scenarios. In this paper, we build an environment for language-guided agents that is highly realistic and reproducible. Specifically, we focus on agents that perform tasks on the web, and create an environment with fully functional websites from four common domains: e-commerce, social forum discussions, collaborative software development, and content management. Our environment is enriched with tools (e.g., a map) and external knowledge bases (e.g., user manuals) to encourage human-like task-solving. Building upon our environment, we release a set of benchmark tasks focusing on evaluating the functional correctness of task completions. The tasks in our benchmark are diverse, long-horizon, and designed to emulate tasks that humans routinely perform on the internet. We experiment with several baseline agents, integrating recent techniques such as reasoning before acting. The results demonstrate that solving complex tasks is challenging: our best GPT-4-based agent only achieves an end-to-end task success rate of 14.41%, significantly lower than the human performance of 78.24%.

This study proposes a novel approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases using microRNA-based gene editing. We used CRISPR-Cas9 system to introduce microRNAs (miRNAs) into neurons, which can modulate the expression of target genes involved in neurodegenerative diseases.

        "abstract": "A growing literature in computational neuroscience leverages gradient descent and learning algorithms that approximate it to study synaptic plasticity in the brain. However, the vast majority of this work ignores a critical underlying assumption: the choice of distance for synaptic changes \u2013 i.e. the geometry of synaptic plasticity. Gradient descent assumes that the distance is Euclidean, but many other distances are possible, and there is no reason that biology necessarily uses Euclidean geometry. Here, using the theoretical tools provided by mirror descent, we show that the distribution of synaptic weights will depend on the geometry of synaptic plasticity. We use these results to show that experimentally-observed log-normal weight distributions found in several brain areas are not consistent with standard gradient descent (i.e. a Euclidean geometry), but rather with nonEuclidean distances. Finally, we show that it should be possible to experimentally test for different synaptic geometries by comparing synaptic weight distributions before and after learning. Overall, our work shows that the current paradigm in theoretical work on synaptic plasticity that assumes Euclidean synaptic geometry may be misguided and that it should be possible to experimentally determine the true geometry of synaptic plasticity in the brain.",

        "abstract": "This work studies the problem of panoptic symbol spotting, which is to spot and parse both countable object instances (windows, doors, tables, etc.) and uncountable stuff (wall, railing, etc.) from computer-aided design (CAD) drawings. Existing methods typically involve either rasterizing the vector graphics into images and using image-based methods for symbol spotting, or directly building graphs and using graph neural networks for symbol recognition. In this paper, we take a different approach, which treats graphic primitives as a set of 2D points that are locally connected and use point cloud segmentation methods to tackle it. Specifically, we utilize a point transformer to extract the primitive features and append a mask2former-like spotting head to predict the final output. To better use the local connection information of primitives and enhance their discriminability, we further propose the attention with connection module (ACM) and contrastive connection learning scheme (CCL). Finally, we propose a KNN interpolation mechanism for the mask attention module of the spotting head to better handle primitive mask downsampling, which is primitive-level in contrast to pixel-level for the image. Our approach, named SymPoint, is simple yet effective, outperforming recent state-of-the-art method GAT-CADNet by an absolute increase of 9.6% PQ and 10.4% RQ on the FloorPlanCAD dataset.

        "abstract": "Recently, it has been shown that for offline deep reinforcement learning (DRL), pre-training Decision Transformer with a large language corpus can improve downstream performance (Reid et al., 2022). A natural question to ask is whether this performance gain can only be achieved with language pre-training, or can be achieved with simpler pre-training schemes which do not involve language. In this paper, we first show that language is not essential for improved performance, and indeed pre-training with synthetic IID data for a small number of updates can match the performance gains from pre-training with a large language corpus; moreover, pre-training with data generated by a one-step Markov chain can further improve the performance. Inspired by these experimental results, we then consider pre-training Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), a popular offline DRL algorithm, which is Q-learning-based and typically employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) backbone. Surprisingly, pre-training with simple synthetic data for a small number of updates can also improve CQL, providing consistent performance improvement on D4RL Gym locomotion datasets. The results of this paper not only illustrate the importance of pre-training for offline DRL but also show that the pre-training data can be synthetic and generated with remarkably simple mechanisms.",

With the recent development of diffusion models, data attribution has become a desired module to properly assign valuations for high-quality or copyrighted training samples, ensuring that data contributors are fairly compensated or credited. Several theoretically motivated methods have been proposed to implement data attribution, in an effort to improve the trade-off between computational scalability and effectiveness. In this work, we conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies on attributing diffusion models, specifically focusing on DDPMs trained on CIFAR-10 and CelebA, as well as a Stable Diffusion model LoRA-finetuned on ArtBench. Intriguingly, we report counter-intuitive observations that theoretically unjustified design choices for attribution empirically outperform previous baselines by a large margin, in terms of both linear datamodeling score and counterfactual evaluation. Our work presents a significantly more efficient approach for attributing diffusion models, while the unexpected findings suggest that at least in non-convex settings, constructions guided by theoretical assumptions may lead to inferior attribution performance.

Our research team has successfully engineered microRNAs to target specific genes involved in the pathogenesis of NDDs, leading to the silencing of these genes. This approach has shown promising results in preclinical studies, with significant improvements in cognitive function, motor function, and overall survival rates. We demonstrate the efficacy of our microRNA-based gene editing approach by targeting the genes associated with Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease. Our results suggest that this approach has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of NDDs, offering a novel therapeutic strategy that can be tailored to individual patient needs.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Introduction:**\nThe introduction sets the stage for the study, clearly outlining the purpose of the research. However, the statement \"neurodegenerative diseases (NDDs) are a major public health concern\" is overly broad, as NDDs encompass a wide range of diseases with distinct pathologies. A more specific statement, focusing on the most common NDDs, would enhance the clarity of the introduction.\n\n**Methods:**\nThe methods are well-described, providing a clear understanding of the microRNA-based gene editing approach. However, the selection of microRNAs to target specific genes is not thoroughly justified. The authors state that \"the specific microRNAs were selected based on their predicted binding sites to disease-associated genes,\" but a more detailed explanation of the selection process would strengthen the study.\n\n**Discussion:**\nThe discussion highlights the promising results of the study, but the authors could have explored the limitations of the approach more thoroughly. For example, the study's reliance on preclinical models may not translate to human clinical trials. Additionally, the authors acknowledge that the current study only targets three NDDs, which raises questions about the approach's potential applicability to other diseases.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe conclusion effectively summarizes the study's findings, but the authors could have emphasized the potential implications of their research more clearly. A more critical evaluation of the study's strengths and limitations would provide a more comprehensive understanding of the microRNA-based gene editing approach.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. The authors could benefit from a more comprehensive review of existing microRNA-based gene editing approaches to ensure that their study is grounded in the current state of knowledge.\n2. A more thorough justification of the microRNA selection process would strengthen the study's validity.\n3. The authors could explore the potential limitations of the approach, including the reliance on preclinical models, to provide a more nuanced understanding of the study's results.\n4.

Our approach involves the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the features of the protein and ligand structures. We evaluate our algorithm on a dataset of 1000 protein-ligand complexes and achieve an average binding affinity prediction accuracy of 85.7%. Our results show that our algorithm outperforms traditional methods in predicting binding affinity and provides a new perspective on the prediction of protein-ligand interactions.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n**Introduction:**\nThe study aims to develop a novel algorithm for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity using deep learning techniques. The researchers claim that their approach is based on the use of a convolutional neural network (CNN) to learn the features of the protein and ligand structures. While the concept of using deep learning for protein structure prediction is not new (1), the application of CNNs to this specific problem is an interesting approach.\n\n**Methodology:**\nThe researchers provide a detailed explanation of their methodological approach. They describe the dataset used for training and testing the algorithm, as well as the architecture of the CNN used. However, upon reviewing the manuscript, I noticed that the dataset used for training and testing is not explicitly described. Furthermore, the researchers mention that the CNN is pre-trained on a large dataset of protein structures but do not provide details on the specific pre-training task or the architecture of the pre-trained model.\n\n**Results:**\nThe results of the study are presented in a clear and concise manner. The researchers report an average binding affinity prediction accuracy of 85.7% on the test dataset. However, I would like to see a detailed breakdown of the accuracy on different classes (e.g., strong binders vs. weak binders). Additionally, the researchers mention that their algorithm outperforms traditional methods but do not provide a direct comparison of their results to those of other studies.\n\n**Discussion:**\nThe discussion section of the manuscript provides a clear summary of the results and their implications. However, I would like to see a more in-depth analysis of the limitations of the study. For instance, the researchers mention that the dataset used for training and testing is limited to 1000 protein-ligand complexes but do not provide any details on the diversity of the dataset. Furthermore, the researchers do not discuss potential sources of bias in the dataset or the algorithm.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe conclusion of the manuscript summarizes the main findings and implications of the study. However, I would like to see a clearer statement on the future directions of the research. For instance, the researchers mention that their algorithm has the potential to be used for predicting binding affinity in other biological systems but do not provide any details on the steps required to adapt the algorithm for these systems.\n\n**Recommendations:**\nBased on the review of the manuscript, I would recommend the following:\n\n1. Provide a detailed explanation of the dataset used for training and testing.\n2. Provide details on the architecture of the pre-trained CNN model used.\n3. Include a detailed breakdown of the accuracy on different classes.\n4. Compare the results of the study to those of other studies in the field.\n5.

        "abstract": "AI systems based on deep learning have reached or surpassed human performance in a range of narrow domains. In coming years or decades, artificial general intelligence (AGI) may surpass human capabilities at many critical tasks. In this position paper, we examine the technical difficulty of fine-tuning hypothetical AGI systems based on pretrained deep models to pursue goals that are aligned with human interests. We argue that, if trained like today\u2019s most capable models, AGI systems could learn to act deceptively to receive higher reward, learn misaligned internally-represented goals which generalize beyond their fine-tuning distributions, and pursue those goals using power-seeking strategies. We review emerging evidence for these properties. AGIs with these properties would be difficult to align and may appear aligned even when they are not.",

The authors describe a novel strategy that combines gene editing, nanoparticle-based drug delivery, and immunotherapy. The introduction effectively sets the stage for the proposed approach, highlighting the need for innovative treatments for AD.\n\n**Methods:**\n\nThe authors describe the use of CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing to target the APOE4 gene, which has been identified as a major risk factor for AD. The gene editing approach aims to reduce the expression of the APOE4 gene, thereby reducing the risk of developing AD. The authors also describe the use of nanoparticles to deliver a small molecule inhibitor of beta-secretase, which plays a key role in the pathogenesis of AD.\n\nThe use of nanoparticles for drug delivery is a promising approach, as it allows for targeted delivery of therapeutic agents to specific cells. However, the authors do not provide sufficient information on the design of the nanoparticles, such as their size, shape, surface charge, and composition. Additionally, the authors do not discuss the potential risks of using nanoparticles, such as toxicity, immune responses, and instability.\n\nThe authors also describe the use of immunotherapy to enhance the efficacy of the gene editing approach. The use of checkpoint inhibitors, such as PD-1/PD-L1, has been shown to be effective in treating various types of cancer. However, the authors do not provide sufficient information on the specific checkpoint inhibitor used, its mechanism of action, and its efficacy in treating AD.\n\n**Results:**\n\nThe authors report the results of the gene editing approach, showing a significant reduction in the expression of the APOE4 gene. However, the results are not detailed enough, as the authors do not provide information on the specificity of the gene editing approach, the efficiency of the gene editing, and the duration of the effects.\n\nThe authors also report the results of the nanoparticle-based drug delivery, showing a significant reduction in beta-secretase activity. However, the results are not detailed enough, as the authors do not provide information on the specificity of the nanoparticle-based drug delivery, the efficiency of the delivery, and the duration of the effects.\n\n**Discussion:**\n\nThe authors discuss the potential benefits of the multi-targeted therapeutic approach, including the reduction of AD risk, the delay of disease progression, and the improvement of cognitive function. However, the discussion lacks depth, as the authors do not provide sufficient information on the potential risks, the limitations of the approach, and the need for further research.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe authors conclude that the multi-targeted therapeutic approach has the potential to revolutionize the treatment of AD. However, the paper lacks depth, as the authors do not provide sufficient information on the design of the nanoparticles, the specificity of the gene editing approach, the efficiency of the nanoparticle-based drug delivery, the duration of the effects, the potential risks, the limitations of the approach, and the need for further research.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1. Provide more detailed information on the design of the nanoparticles, including their size, shape, surface charge, and composition.\n2. Discuss the potential risks of using nanoparticles, such as toxicity, immune responses, and instability.\n3.

        "abstract": "Text-to-3D generation has made remarkable progress recently, particularly with methods based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) that leverages pre-trained 2D diffusion models. While the usage of classifier-free guidance is well acknowledged to be crucial for successful optimization, it is considered an auxiliary trick rather than the most essential component. In this paper, we re-evaluate the role of classifier-free guidance in score distillation and discover a surprising finding: the guidance alone is enough for effective text-to-3D generation tasks. We name this method Classifier Score Distillation (CSD), which can be interpreted as using an implicit classification model for generation. This new perspective reveals new insights for understanding existing techniques. We validate the effectiveness of CSD across a variety of text-to-3D tasks including shape generation, texture synthesis, and shape editing, achieving results superior to those of state-of-the-art methods.

Our algorithm draws inspiration from the recent work of Chen et al., who developed DP algorithms for recovery of stochastic block models in cases where the graph comprises exactly two nearly-balanced clusters. Our algorithm works for well-clustered graphs with k nearly-balanced clusters, and the misclassification ratio almost matches the one of the best-known non-private algorithms.

This not only causes the loss of dynamic information but also triggers huge computational consumption. To solve the problem, we propose a general framework for deep Temporal Graph Clustering called TGC, which introduces deep clustering techniques to suit the interaction sequence-based batch-processing pattern of temporal graphs. In addition, we discuss differences between temporal graph clustering and static graph clustering from several levels. To verify the superiority of the proposed framework TGC, we conduct extensive experiments. The experimental results show that temporal graph clustering enables more flexibility in finding a balance between time and space requirements, and our framework can effectively improve the performance of existing temporal graph learning methods.

This study proposes a novel approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases using microRNA-based gene editing. We used CRISPR-Cas9 system to introduce microRNAs (miRNAs) into neurons, which can modulate the expression of target genes involved in neurodegenerative diseases.

However, achieving this can be fundamentally challenging, as it requires the ability to learn invariant features across different domains or environments. In this paper, we propose a novel framework HYPO (HYPerspherical OOD generalization) that provably learns domain-invariant representations in a hyperspherical space. In particular, our hyperspherical learning algorithm is guided by intra-class variation and inter-class separation principles\u2014ensuring that features from the same class (across different training domains) are closely aligned with their class prototypes, while different class prototypes are maximally separated. We further provide theoretical justifications on how our prototypical learning objective improves the OOD generalization bound.

        "abstract": "Audio-visual speech separation methods aim to integrate different modalities to generate high-quality separated speech, thereby enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as speech recognition. Most existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models operate in the time domain. However, their overly simplistic approach to modeling acoustic features often necessitates larger and more computationally intensive models in order to achieve SOTA performance. In this paper, we present a novel time-frequency domain audio-visual speech separation method: Recurrent Time-Frequency Separation Network (RTFS-Net), which applies its algorithms on the complex time-frequency bins yielded by the Short-Time Fourier Transform. We model and capture the time and frequency dimensions of the audio independently using a multi-layered RNN along each dimension. Furthermore, we introduce a unique attention-based fusion technique for the efficient integration of audio and visual information, and a new mask separation approach that takes advantage of the intrinsic spectral nature of the acoustic features for a clearer separation. RTFS-Net outperforms the prior SOTA method in both inference speed and separation quality while reducing the number of parameters by 90% and MACs by 83%. This is the first time-frequency domain audio-visual speech separation method to outperform all contemporary time-domain counterparts.",

        "abstract": "Conditional diffusion models have exhibited superior performance in high-fidelity text-guided visual generation and editing. Nevertheless, prevailing text-guided visual diffusion models primarily focus on incorporating text-visual relationships exclusively into the reverse process, often disregarding their relevance in the forward process. This inconsistency between forward and reverse processes may limit the precise conveyance of textual semantics in visual synthesis results. To address this issue, we propose a novel and general contextualized diffusion model (CONTEXTDIFF) by incorporating the cross-modal context encompassing interactions and alignments between text condition and visual sample into forward and reverse processes. We propagate this context to all timesteps in the two processes to adapt their trajectories, thereby facilitating cross-modal conditional modeling. We generalize our contextualized diffusion to both DDPMs and DDIMs with theoretical derivations, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in evaluations with two challenging tasks: text-to-image generation, and text-to-video editing. In each task, our CONTEXTDIFF achieves new state-of-the-art performance, significantly enhancing the semantic alignment between text condition and generated samples, as evidenced by quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

        "abstract": "Recent empirical evidence indicates that transformer based in-context learning performs better when using a prefix language model (prefixLM), in which incontext samples can all attend to each other, compared to causal language models (causalLM), which use auto-regressive attention that prohibits in-context samples to attend to future samples. While this result is intuitive, it is not understood from a theoretical perspective. In this paper we take a theoretical approach and analyze the convergence behavior of prefixLM and causalLM under a certain parameter construction. Our analysis shows that both LM types converge to their stationary points at a linear rate, but that while prefixLM converges to the optimal solution of linear regression, causalLM convergence dynamics follows that of an online gradient descent algorithm, which is not guaranteed to be optimal even as the number of samples grows infinitely. We supplement our theoretical claims with empirical experiments over synthetic and real tasks and using various types of transformers. Our experiments verify that causalLM consistently underperforms prefixLM in all settings.",

The data was then preprocessed and feature engineered to prepare it for machine learning algorithms. The researchers used a combination of machine learning algorithms, including Random Forest, Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), to predict maintenance needs. The performance of the models was evaluated using various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results section of the paper presents the performance of the machine learning models on the test dataset. The researchers found that the Random Forest algorithm achieved the highest accuracy (92.5%) and precision (85.6%) on the test dataset. The SVM algorithm performed well, achieving an accuracy of 90.2% and precision of 83.1%. The CNN algorithm showed the lowest performance, with an accuracy of 80.5% and precision of 75.6%.\n\n**Discussion**\n\nThe discussion section of the paper provides an in-depth analysis of the results and their implications.

The researchers conclude that the proposed approach to predictive maintenance using machine learning and sensor data is effective and can be used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of maintenance operations.\n\n**Critique**\n\nThe paper provides a thorough and well-structured overview of the current state of predictive maintenance and the potential benefits of using machine learning algorithms and sensor data. However, there are several limitations to the study that need to be addressed. The limited dataset used in the study is a major concern, and further research is needed to validate the results. Additionally, the paper does not provide a clear explanation of the feature selection process, which is an important step in machine learning algorithm development.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nBased on the critique, I recommend that the researchers:\n\n1. Use a more comprehensive dataset to validate the results.\n2. Provide a clear explanation of the feature selection process.\n3. Explore other machine learning algorithms to compare their performance.\n4. Investigate the potential impact of sensor data quality on the performance of the machine learning models.\n\n**Overall Assessment**\n\nThe paper provides a well-structured and thorough overview of the current state of predictive maintenance and the potential benefits of using machine learning algorithms and sensor data. However, the limitations of the study need to be addressed through further research. With some modifications, the proposed approach to predictive maintenance using machine learning and sensor data has the potential to be effective and can be used to improve the accuracy and efficiency of maintenance operations.\n\nRating: 8/10\n\n**Conflict of Interest**\n\nThe reviewer has no conflict of interest to declare.\n\n**Certification**\n\nThe reviewer certifies that this review is an independent and unbiased assessment of the paper.\n\n**Acknowledgement**\n\nThe reviewer would like to acknowledge the contributions of the researchers to the field of predictive maintenance and the potential benefits of using machine learning algorithms and sensor data in this context.",

        "abstract": "Following the success of Large Language Models (LLMs), Large Multimodal Models (LMMs), such as the Flamingo model and its subsequent competitors, have started to emerge as natural steps towards generalist agents. However, interacting with recent LMMs reveals major limitations that are hardly captured by the current evaluation benchmarks. Indeed, task performances (e.g., VQA accuracy) alone do not provide enough clues to understand their real capabilities, limitations, and to which extent such models are aligned to human expectations. To refine our understanding of those flaws, we deviate from the current evaluation paradigm, and (1) evaluate 10 recent open-source LMMs from 3B up to 80B parameter scale, on 5 different axes; hallucinations, abstention, compositionality, explainability and instruction following. Our evaluation on these axes reveals major flaws in LMMs. While the current go-to solution to align these models is based on training, such as instruction tuning or RLHF, we rather (2) explore the training-free in-context learning (ICL) as a solution, and study how it affects these limitations. Based on our ICL study, (3) we push ICL further and propose new multimodal ICL variants such as; Multitask-ICL, Chain-of-Hindsight-ICL, and Self-Correcting-ICL. Our findings are as follows; (1) Despite their success, LMMs have flaws that remain unsolved with scaling alone. (2) The effect of ICL on LMMs flaws is nuanced; despite its effectiveness for improved explainability, answer abstention, ICL only slightly improves instruction following, does not improve compositional abilities, and actually even amplifies hallucinations. (3) The proposed ICL variants are promising as post-hoc approaches to efficiently tackle some of those flaws. The code is available here: https://github.com/mshukor/EvALign-ICL.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents Tag2Text, a vision language pre-training (VLP) framework, which introduces image tagging into vision-language models to guide the learning of visual-linguistic features. In contrast to prior works which utilize object tags either manually labeled or automatically detected with an off-the-shelf detector with limited performance, our approach explicitly learns an image tagger using tags parsed from image-paired text and thus provides a strong semantic guidance to vision-language models. In this way, Tag2Text can utilize largescale annotation-free image tags in accordance with image-text pairs, and provides more diverse tag categories beyond objects. As a result, Tag2Text demonstrates the ability of a foundational image tagging model, with superior zero-shot performance even comparable to fully supervised models. Moreover, by leveraging the tagging guidance, Tag2Text effectively enhances the performance of visionlanguage models on both generation-based and alignment-based tasks. Across a wide range of downstream benchmarks, Tag2Text achieves state-of-the-art results with similar model sizes and data scales, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed tagging guidance.

        "abstract": "Equivariant Transformers such as Equiformer have demonstrated the efficacy of applying Transformers to the domain of 3D atomistic systems. However, they are limited to small degrees of equivariant representations due to their computational complexity. In this paper, we investigate whether these architectures can scale well to higher degrees. Starting from Equiformer, we first replace SOp3q convolutions with eSCN convolutions to efficiently incorporate higher-degree tensors. Then, to better leverage the power of higher degrees, we propose three architectural improvements \u2013 attention re-normalization, separable S activation and separable layer normalization. Putting this all together, we propose EquiformerV2, which outperforms previous state-of-the-art methods on large-scale OC20 dataset by up to 9% on forces, 4% on energies, offers better speed-accuracy trade-offs, and 2\u02c6 reduction in DFT calculations needed for computing adsorption energies. Additionally, EquiformerV2 trained on only OC22 dataset outperforms GemNet-OC trained on both OC20 and OC22 datasets, achieving much better data efficiency. Finally, we compare EquiformerV2 with Equiformer on QM9 and OC20 S2EF-2M datasets to better understand the performance gain brought by higher degrees.",

        "abstract": "The genome sequence contains the blueprint for governing cellular processes. While the availability of genomes has vastly increased over the last decades, experimental annotation of the various functional, non-coding and regulatory elements encoded in the DNA sequence remains both expensive and challenging. This has sparked interest in unsupervised language modeling of genomic DNA, a paradigm that has seen great success for protein sequence data. Although various DNA language models have been proposed, evaluation tasks often differ between individual works, and might not fully recapitulate the fundamental challenges of genome annotation, including the length, scale and sparsity of the data. In this study, we introduce BEND, a Benchmark for DNA language models, featuring a collection of realistic and biologically meaningful downstream tasks defined on the human genome. We find that embeddings from current DNA LMs can approach performance of expert methods on some tasks, but only capture limited information about long-range features.

        "abstract": "Collecting large amounts of real-world interaction data to train general robotic policies is often prohibitively expensive, thus motivating the use of simulation data. However, existing methods for data generation have generally focused on scenelevel diversity (e.g., object instances and poses) rather than task-level diversity, due to the human effort required to come up with and verify novel tasks. This has made it challenging for policies trained on simulation data to demonstrate significant task-level generalization. In this paper, we propose to automatically generate rich simulation environments and expert demonstrations by exploiting a large language models\u2019 (LLM) grounding and coding ability. Our approach, dubbed GENSIM, has two modes: goal-directed generation, wherein a target task is given to the LLM and the LLM proposes a task curriculum to solve the target task, and exploratory generation, wherein the LLM bootstraps from previous tasks and iteratively proposes novel tasks that would be helpful in solving more complex tasks. We use GPT4 to expand the existing benchmark by ten times to over 100 tasks, on which we conduct supervised finetuning and evaluate several LLMs including finetuned GPTs and Code Llama on code generation for robotic simulation tasks. Furthermore, we observe that LLMs-generated simulation programs can enhance task-level generalization significantly when used for multitask policy training. We further find that with minimal sim-to-real adaptation, the multitask policies pretrained on GPT4-generated simulation tasks exhibit stronger transfer to unseen long-horizon tasks in the real world and outperform baselines by 25%. 1",

        "abstract": "Modeling long-range dependencies across sequences is a longstanding goal in machine learning and has led to architectures, such as state space models, that dramatically outperform Transformers on long sequences. However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using only the downstream task data, leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining. Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on supervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is essential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently.",

This study proposes a novel approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases using microRNA-based gene editing. We used CRISPR-Cas9 system and microRNA library screening approach to modify the expression of microRNAs in the brains of mice models of neurodegenerative diseases. Our results showed that the modified microRNA-based gene editing approach significantly reduced the levels of toxic proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases, improved cognitive function, and increased the survival rate of mice. These findings suggest that microRNA-based gene editing may be a promising therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nNeurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and Huntington's disease, are characterized by progressive neuronal loss and cognitive decline. Current treatments for these diseases are limited, and there is an urgent need for novel therapeutic approaches. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that play a crucial role in regulating gene expression. Recent studies have shown that miRNAs are involved in the pathogenesis of neurodegenerative diseases, and their dysregulation may contribute to the disease phenotype. Therefore, modifying the expression of miRNAs using gene editing tools such as CRISPR-Cas9 may be a promising therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**Methods:**\n\nIn this study, we used CRISPR-Cas9 system and microRNA library screening approach to modify the expression of microRNAs in the brains of mice models of neurodegenerative diseases. We designed a CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA (gRNA) targeting specific miRNAs involved in neurodegeneration and delivered it into the brains of mice using viral vectors. We then screened the brains for the expression of the modified miRNAs using qRT-PCR. We also evaluated the effects of the modified miRNAs on cognitive function and survival rate using behavioral assays and survival analysis.\n\n**Results:**\n\nOur results showed that the modified microRNA-based gene editing approach significantly reduced the levels of toxic proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases, improved cognitive function, and increased the survival rate of mice. We also found that the modified miRNAs were specifically expressed in the brains of mice and were not detected in the peripheral tissues.\n\n**Discussion:**\n\nOur findings suggest that microRNA-based gene editing may be a promising therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases. The reduction of toxic proteins and improvement in cognitive function observed in this study are consistent with previous reports of miRNA-based therapies. However, further studies are needed to confirm these findings and explore the potential mechanisms of action of microRNA-based gene editing in neurodegenerative diseases. Additionally, the specificity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system and the delivery of the gRNA into the brains of mice are important considerations.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nIn conclusion, this study demonstrates the feasibility of using microRNA-based gene editing as a therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases. While further research is needed, our findings suggest that microRNA-based gene editing may be a promising area of investigation for the treatment of these diseases.\n\n**Critique:**\n\nThe study proposes a novel approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases using microRNA-based gene editing. The use of CRISPR-Cas9 system and microRNA library screening approach is an innovative approach, and the results suggest that this approach may be effective in reducing the levels of toxic proteins associated with neurodegenerative diseases. However, there are several concerns that need to be addressed:\n\n1. **Specificity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system:** The CRISPR-Cas9 system is a powerful tool, but its specificity is a major concern. The study failed to demonstrate the specificity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in this study, and further research is needed to confirm this.\n2. **Delivery of the gRNA into the brains of mice:** The study used viral vectors to deliver the gRNA into the brains of mice. However, the efficiency of this delivery method is not well understood, and further research is needed to confirm its efficacy.\n3. **Expression of modified miRNAs in peripheral tissues:** The study found that the modified miRNAs were not detected in the peripheral tissues. However, this may not be a reliable indicator of the specificity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, and further research is needed to confirm this.\n4. **Cognitive function and survival rate:** The study found that the modified microRNA-based gene editing approach improved cognitive function and increased the survival rate of mice. However, these findings are based on a small sample size, and further research is needed to confirm these results.\n5. **Potential off-target effects:** The CRISPR-Cas9 system is a powerful tool, but it is not without risks. The study failed to address the potential off-target effects of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, and further research is needed to confirm its safety.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. **Further research on specificity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system:** Further research is needed to confirm the specificity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system in this study.\n2. **Optimization of delivery of the gRNA into the brains of mice:** Further research is needed to optimize the delivery of the gRNA into the brains of mice.\n3. **Expression of modified miRNAs in peripheral tissues:** Further research is needed to confirm the specificity of the CRISPR-Cas9 system and the expression of modified miRNAs in peripheral tissues.\n4. **Large-scale study:** A large-scale study is needed to confirm the findings of this study and explore the potential mechanisms of action of microRNA-based gene editing in neurodegenerative diseases.\n5. **Safety assessment:** A safety assessment is needed to confirm the safety of the CRISPR-Cas9 system and the potential off-target effects.\n\n**Final Score:** 7/10\n\n**Reviewer's Comments:**\n\nThis study proposes a novel approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases using microRNA-based gene editing.

        "title": "S2AC: ENERGY-BASED REINFORCEMENT LEARNING WITH STEIN SOFT ACTOR CRITIC",
        "abstract": "Learning expressive stochastic policies instead of deterministic ones has been proposed to achieve better stability, sample complexity, and robustness. Notably, in Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL), the policy is modeled as an expressive Energy-Based Model (EBM) over the Q-values. However, this formulation requires the estimation of the entropy of such EBMs, which is an open problem. To address this, previous MaxEnt RL methods either implicitly estimate the entropy, resulting in high computational complexity and variance (SQL), or follow a variational inference procedure that fits simplified actor distributions (e.g., Gaussian) for tractability (SAC). We propose Stein Soft Actor-Critic (S2AC), a MaxEnt RL algorithm that learns expressive policies without compromising efficiency. Specifically, S2AC uses parameterized Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) as the underlying policy. We derive a closed-form expression of the entropy of such policies. Our formula is computationally efficient and only depends on first-order derivatives and vector products. Empirical results show that S2AC yields more optimal solutions to the MaxEnt objective than SQL and SAC in the multi-goal environment, and outperforms SAC and SQL on the MuJoCo benchmark.

        "abstract": "Deep reinforcement learning has recently been successfully applied to online procedural content generation in which a policy determines promising game-level segments. However, existing methods can hardly discover diverse level patterns, while the lack of diversity makes the gameplay boring. This paper proposes an ensemble reinforcement learning approach that uses multiple negatively correlated sub-policies to generate different alternative level segments, and stochastically selects one of them following a dynamic selector policy. A novel policy regularisation technique is integrated into the approach to diversify the generated alternatives. In addition, we develop theorems to provide general methodologies for optimising policy regularisation in a Markov decision process. The proposed approach is compared with several state-of-the-art policy ensemble methods and classic methods on a well-known level generation benchmark, with two different reward functions expressing game-design goals from different perspectives. Results show that our approach boosts level diversity notably with competitive performance in terms of the reward. Furthermore, by varying the regularisation coefficient values, the trained generators form a well-spread Pareto front, allowing explicit trade-offs between diversity and rewards of generated levels.",

        "title": "EFFICIENT COMPUTER VISION?",
        "abstract": "Binary Neural networks (BNN) have emerged as an attractive computing paradigm for a wide range of low-power vision tasks. However, state-of-theart (SOTA) BNNs do not yield any sparsity, and induce a significant number of non-binary operations. On the other hand, activation sparsity can be provided by spiking neural networks (SNN), that too have gained significant traction in recent times. Thanks to this sparsity, SNNs when implemented on neuromorphic hardware, have the potential to be significantly more power-efficient compared to traditional artifical neural networks (ANN). However, SNNs incur multiple time steps to achieve close to SOTA accuracy. Ironically, this increases latency and energy\u2014costs that SNNs were proposed to reduce\u2014and presents itself as a major hurdle in realizing SNNs\u2019 theoretical gains in practice. This raises an intriguing question: Can we obtain SNN-like sparsity and BNN-like accuracy and enjoy the energy-efficiency benefits of both? To answer this question, in this paper, we present a training framework for sparse binary activation neural networks (BANN) using a novel variant of the Hoyer regularizer. We estimate the threshold of each BANN layer as the Hoyer extremum of a clipped version of its activation map, where the clipping value is trained using gradient descent with our Hoyer regularizer. This approach shifts the activation values away from the threshold, thereby mitigating the effect of noise that can otherwise degrade the BANN accuracy. Our approach outperforms existing BNNs, SNNs, and adder neural networks (that also avoid energy-expensive multiplication operations similar to BNNs and SNNs) in terms of the accuracy-FLOPs trade-off for complex image recognition tasks. Downstream experiments on object detection further demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Lastly, we demonstrate the portability of our approach to SNNs with multiple time steps. Codes are publicly available here.",

        "title": "A PARADIGM SHIFT IN MACHINE TRANSLATION: BOOSTING TRANSLATION PERFORMANCE OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS",
        "abstract": "Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in various NLP tasks. However, these advances have not been reflected in the translation task, especially those with moderate model sizes (i.e., 7B or 13B parameters), which still lag behind conventional supervised encoder-decoder translation models. Previous studies have attempted to improve the translation capabilities of these LLMs, but their gains have been limited. In this study, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach for LLMs that is specifically designed for the translation task, eliminating the need for the abundant parallel data that traditional translation models usually depend on. Our approach consists of two finetuning stages: initial fine-tuning on monolingual data followed by subsequent fine-tuning on a small set of high-quality parallel data. We introduce the LLM developed through this strategy as Advanced Language Model-based trAnslator (ALMA). Based on LLaMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023b) as our underlying model, our results show that the model can achieve an average improvement of more than 12 BLEU and 12 COMET over its zero-shot performance across 10 translation directions from the WMT\u201921 (2 directions) and WMT\u201922 (8 directions) test datasets. The performance is significantly better than all prior work and even superior to the NLLB-54B model (NLLB TEAM et al., 2022) and GPT3.5-text-davinci-003, with only 7B or 13B parameters. This method establishes the foundation for a novel training paradigm in machine translation. 1",

        "abstract": "Human motion driven control (HMDC) is an effective approach for generating natural and compelling robot motions while preserving high-level semantics. However, establishing the correspondence between humans and robots with different body structures is not straightforward due to the mismatches in kinematics and dynamics properties, which causes intrinsic ambiguity to the problem. Many previous algorithms approach this motion retargeting problem with unsupervised learning, which requires the prerequisite skill sets. However, it will be extremely costly to learn all the skills without understanding the given human motions, particularly for high-dimensional robots. In this work, we introduce CrossLoco, a guided unsupervised reinforcement learning framework that simultaneously learns robot skills and their correspondence to human motions. Our key innovation is to introduce a cycle-consistency-based reward term designed to maximize the mutual information between human motions and robot states. We demonstrate that the proposed framework can generate compelling robot motions by translating diverse human motions, such as running, hopping, and dancing. We quantitatively compare our CrossLoco against the manually engineered and unsupervised baseline algorithms along with the ablated versions of our framework and demonstrate that our method translates human motions with better accuracy, diversity, and user preference. We also showcase its utility in other applications, such as synthesizing robot movements from language input and enabling interactive robot control.",

The authors correctly highlight the importance of miRNAs in treating neurodegenerative diseases. However, I would have liked to see a more detailed explanation of how miRNAs are regulated in neurons and their relationship with other signaling pathways.\n\n**Methods**\n\nThe authors describe a novel approach to using microRNA-146a (miR-146a) inhibitors to treat neurodegenerative diseases. While I was intrigued by this approach, I had several concerns regarding the experimental design. Firstly, I would have liked to see a more detailed explanation of how miR-146a inhibitors were designed and synthesized. Additionally, I would have liked to see more information on how the inhibitors were validated in vitro and in vivo. The authors also mention that miR-146a inhibitors were used in combination with other therapeutic strategies, which raised questions about how these combinations were evaluated.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results section presents data on miR-146a expression levels in brains of patients with neurodegenerative diseases, which suggests that miR-146a may play a role in these diseases. However, I would have liked to see more detailed analysis of these data, including statistical analysis and comparisons to controls. Additionally, I would have liked to see more information on how miR-146a inhibitors were used to modulate miR-146a expression levels in neurons.\n\n**Discussion**\n\nThe authors discuss the potential therapeutic benefits of using miR-146a inhibitors to treat neurodegenerative diseases. While their arguments are convincing, I would have liked to see more detailed analysis of how these inhibitors interact with other signaling pathways and how they may affect other miRNAs. Additionally, I would have liked to see more information on how these inhibitors may affect long-term outcomes, such as cognitive function and motor function.\n\n**Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, while this paper presents an interesting approach to using miR-146a inhibitors to treat neurodegenerative diseases, there are several areas that require further investigation.

        "abstract": "Denoising diffusion models enable conditional generation and density modeling of complex relationships like images and text. However, the nature of the learned relationships is opaque making it difficult to understand precisely what relationships between words and parts of an image are captured, or to predict the effect of an intervention. We illuminate the fine-grained relationships learned by diffusion models by noticing a precise relationship between diffusion and information decomposition. Exact expressions for mutual information and conditional mutual information can be written in terms of the denoising model. Furthermore, pointwise estimates can be easily estimated as well, allowing us to ask questions about the relationships between specific images and captions. Decomposing information even further to understand which variables in a high-dimensional space carry information is a long-standing problem. For diffusion models, we show that a natural non-negative decomposition of mutual information emerges, allowing us to quantify informative relationships between words and pixels in an image. We exploit these new relations to measure the compositional understanding of diffusion models, to do unsupervised localization of objects in images, and to measure effects when selectively editing images through prompt interventions.",

The authors acknowledge the potential benefits of AI in improving healthcare delivery, but express concerns about its limitations and potential risks.\n\n**Methodology**\n\nThe study employs a mixed-methods approach, combining both qualitative and quantitative data collection and analysis methods. The authors conducted in-depth interviews with experts in the field of AI and medicine, as well as a survey of healthcare professionals to gather data on their perceptions and experiences with AI in healthcare.\n\nThe study's sample size is not explicitly stated, but the authors claim to have conducted a total of \"over 100\" interviews and surveys, which is a relatively small sample size for a study of this scope.\n\n**Results**\n\nThe results of the study show that the majority of healthcare professionals surveyed were optimistic about the potential of AI to improve healthcare delivery, but were concerned about its limitations, such as data quality and bias in AI algorithms.\n\nThe qualitative interviews with experts in the field revealed a range of perspectives on the impact of AI on medicine, including both positive and negative views.\n\n**Discussion**\n\nThe discussion section of the study provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of AI in healthcare, including its applications, limitations, and potential risks.\n\nThe authors conclude that AI has the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, but that it must be used responsibly and with caution.\n\n**Critical Review**\n\nOverall, this study provides a valuable contribution to the field of AI in healthcare, but it has several limitations.\n\nOne of the main limitations of the study is its small sample size, which may not be representative of the entire healthcare community.\n\nAnother limitation is the lack of quantitative data on the actual impact of AI on healthcare delivery, which makes it difficult to draw firm conclusions about its potential benefits and risks.\n\nAdditionally, the study's reliance on expert opinions and survey data may not provide a comprehensive understanding of the complex issues surrounding AI in healthcare.\n\nFurthermore, the study's conclusion that AI has the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery, but must be used responsibly and with caution, is overly simplistic and does not provide a clear roadmap for how this can be achieved.\n\n**Recommendations**\n\nTo improve the validity and reliability of this study, I recommend that the authors:\n\n1. Use a more representative sample size, such as a randomized controlled trial or a large-scale survey.\n2. Include more quantitative data on the actual impact of AI on healthcare delivery, such as patient outcomes and cost savings.\n3. Incorporate more diverse perspectives, including those of patients and caregivers, to provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complex issues surrounding AI in healthcare.\n4. Provide a more detailed and nuanced discussion of the potential risks and benefits of AI in healthcare, including its impact on job displacement and healthcare resource allocation.\n\n**Final Thoughts**\n\nOverall, this study provides a valuable contribution to the field of AI in healthcare, but it has several limitations that need to be addressed in future research.\n\nBy acknowledging and addressing these limitations, the authors can provide a more comprehensive and nuanced understanding of the complex issues surrounding AI in healthcare, and provide a clearer roadmap for how AI can be used responsibly and effectively to improve healthcare delivery.\n\nI would recommend that the authors revise and resubmit their manuscript, taking into consideration the recommendations outlined above.\n\nRating: (3/5)\n\nRecommendation: Revise and Resubmit",

However, since sampling introduces approximations to training, such algorithms may not consistently maintain accuracy across various tasks. In this work, we introduce a variance-controlled adaptive sampling (VCAS) method designed to accelerate BP. VCAS computes an unbiased stochastic gradient with fine-grained layerwise importance sampling in data dimension for activation gradient calculation and leverage score sampling in token dimension for weight gradient calculation. To preserve accuracy, we control the additional variance by learning the sample ratio jointly with model parameters during training. We assessed VCAS on multiple fine-tuning and pre-training tasks in both vision and natural language domains. On all the tasks, VCAS can preserve the original training loss trajectory and validation accuracy with an up to 73.87% FLOPs reduction of BP and 49.58% FLOPs reduction of the whole training process.

The literature suggests that climate change poses significant threats to food security, including increased temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and rising sea levels. We analyze various empirical studies to assess the impact of climate change on crop yields, food prices, and human well-being. Our findings indicate that climate change has a substantial impact on global food security, and urgent action is needed to mitigate its effects. \n\nIntroduction:\nClimate change has become a pressing global issue, with far-reaching impacts on human societies and ecosystems. The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates that climate change will cause 143 million additional deaths by 2050 due to malnutrition, malaria, and heat stress. The impact of climate change on food security has been extensively studied, with a growing body of empirical evidence highlighting its significance. \n\nMethodology:\nThis study employs a systematic literature review approach, analyzing 150 empirical studies on climate change's impact on food security. We use a combination of quantitative and qualitative methods to assess the impact of climate change on crop yields, food prices, and human well-being. \n\nResults:\nOur analysis reveals that climate change has a significant impact on global food security, with effects observed in crop yields, food prices, and human well-being. The results indicate that climate change will exacerbate food insecurity in vulnerable communities, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. \n\nDiscussion:\nOur findings are consistent with previous studies, which suggest that climate change poses significant threats to food security. The impact of climate change on crop yields, food prices, and human well-being has been extensively studied, and our results support this evidence. The urgent need for mitigation action to address climate change's effects on food security cannot be overstated. \n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, this study provides a comprehensive overview of empirical evidence on climate change's impact on global food security. Our findings highlight the need for urgent action to mitigate climate change's effects on food security, particularly in vulnerable communities. \n\nPeer Review: \n\nOverall, this paper provides a clear and concise overview of empirical evidence on climate change's impact on global food security.

        "abstract": "Unsupervised pre-training strategies have proven to be highly effective in natural language processing and computer vision. Likewise, unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) holds the promise of discovering a variety of potentially useful behaviors that can accelerate the learning of a wide array of downstream tasks. Previous unsupervised RL approaches have mainly focused on pure exploration and mutual information skill learning. However, despite the previous attempts, making unsupervised RL truly scalable still remains a major open challenge: pure exploration approaches might struggle in complex environments with large state spaces, where covering every possible transition is infeasible, and mutual information skill learning approaches might completely fail to explore the environment due to the lack of incentives. To make unsupervised RL scalable to complex, high-dimensional environments, we propose a novel unsupervised RL objective, which we call Metric-Aware Abstraction (METRA). Our main idea is, instead of directly covering the entire state space, to only cover a compact latent space Z that is metrically connected to the state space S by temporal distances. By learning to move in every direction in the latent space, METRA obtains a tractable set of diverse behaviors that approximately cover the state space, being scalable to high-dimensional environments. Through our experiments in five locomotion and manipulation environments, we demonstrate that METRA can discover a variety of useful behaviors even in complex, pixel-based environments, being the first unsupervised RL method that discovers diverse locomotion behaviors in pixel-based Quadruped and Humanoid.

This study contributes to our understanding of the complex relationships between climate change, ecosystem dynamics, and the distribution of aquatic species.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. **Methodological approach**: The authors employed a multi-faceted approach, combining field observations, statistical analysis, and modeling to investigate the responses of amphipod populations to climate change.\n2. **Data quality and availability**: The authors utilized long-term datasets and robust statistical methods to ensure the reliability and accuracy of their findings.\n3. **Clear and concise writing style**: The paper is well-organized, and the authors effectively communicate their research objectives, methods, and results in a clear and concise manner.\n\n**Weaknesses and Critique:**\n\n1. **Limited spatial and temporal scope**: Although the study examines the distribution and abundance of amphipod populations in freshwater lakes, the authors focus primarily on the impacts of climate change on these populations within the Great Lakes region. A more comprehensive spatial and temporal analysis would strengthen the paper's findings.\n2. **Simplistic climate change model**: While the authors acknowledge the complexity of climate change, they use a simplified model to predict future changes in amphipod populations. A more nuanced model, incorporating multiple climate variables and non-linear interactions, would provide more realistic predictions.\n3. **Lack of comparison with other aquatic species**: By focusing primarily on amphipods, the authors miss the opportunity to explore the broader implications of climate change on aquatic ecosystems. A comparison with other aquatic species would enhance the paper's relevance and generalizability.\n\n**Suggestions for Future Research:**\n\n1. **Expand the spatial and temporal scope**: Conduct studies in multiple freshwater lake systems to explore the regional and seasonal impacts of climate change on amphipod populations.\n2. **Integrate more complex climate models**: Develop and apply more sophisticated climate models, incorporating multiple climate variables and non-linear interactions, to predict future changes in amphipod populations.\n3. **Investigate the responses of multiple aquatic species**: Conduct comparative studies with other aquatic species to explore the broader implications of climate change on aquatic ecosystems.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThis paper provides valuable insights into the impacts of climate change on amphipod populations in freshwater lakes. While the study has several strengths, it is limited by its spatial and temporal scope, simplistic climate change model, and lack of comparison with other aquatic species. Future research should aim to address these weaknesses, expanding the scope of the study and incorporating more complex climate models to provide more realistic predictions.",

        "abstract": "Existing analyses of the expressive capacity of Transformer models have required excessively deep layers for data memorization, leading to a discrepancy with the Transformers actually used in practice. This is primarily due to the interpretation of the softmax function as an approximation of the hardmax function. By clarifying the connection between the softmax function and the Boltzmann operator, we prove that a single layer of self-attention with low-rank weight matrices possesses the capability to perfectly capture the context of an entire input sequence. As a consequence, we show that one-layer and single-head Transformers have a memorization capacity for finite samples, and that Transformers consisting of one self-attention layer with two feed-forward neural networks are universal approximators for continuous permutation equivariant functions on a compact domain.",

        "title": "TERNATING DENOISING DIFFUSION PROCESS",
        "abstract": "Image recognition and generation have long been developed independently of each other. With the recent trend towards general-purpose representation learning, the development of general representations for both recognition and generation tasks is also promoted. However, preliminary attempts mainly focus on generation performance, but are still inferior on recognition tasks. These methods are modeled in the vector-quantized (VQ) space, whereas leading recognition methods use pixels as inputs. Our key insights are twofold: (1) pixels as inputs are crucial for recognition tasks; (2) VQ tokens as reconstruction targets are beneficial for generation tasks. These observations motivate us to propose an Alternating Denoising Diffusion Process (ADDP) that integrates these two spaces within a single representation learning framework. In each denoising step, our method first decodes pixels from previous VQ tokens, then generates new VQ tokens from the decoded pixels. The diffusion process gradually masks out a portion of VQ tokens to construct the training samples. The learned representations can be used to generate diverse high-fidelity images and also demonstrate excellent transfer performance on recognition tasks. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves competitive performance on unconditional generation, ImageNet classification, COCO detection, and ADE20k segmentation. Importantly, our method represents the first successful development of general representations applicable to both generation and dense recognition tasks.

We utilize a combination of convolutional neural networks (CNN) and recurrent neural networks (RNN) to predict the binding affinity of proteins to their ligands. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 90% and outperforms traditional machine learning models.\n\n**Full Paper:**\n\n**1. Introduction**\n\nProtein-ligand binding affinity is a crucial parameter for drug discovery and development. Accurate predictions of binding affinity can significantly impact the success of a drug. Traditional machine learning models have been used to predict protein-ligand binding affinity with varying degrees of accuracy. However, these models often require extensive feature engineering and are prone to overfitting.\n\nIn this paper, we present a novel deep learning-based approach for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity. We combine the strengths of CNN and RNN to leverage the spatial and temporal patterns present in protein-ligand binding data.\n\n**2. Methods**\n\nOur approach involves the following steps:\n\n1. Data collection: We collect a dataset of 10,000 protein-ligand binding interactions.\n2. Data preprocessing: We normalize the binding free energies of the dataset.\n3. Feature engineering: We extract features from the normalized binding free energies using a combination of statistical and machine learning techniques.\n4. Model training: We train a CNN-RNN hybrid model using the extracted features and a loss function based on mean squared error.\n5. Model evaluation: We evaluate the performance of the proposed model using a leave-one-out cross-validation approach.\n\n**3. Results**\n\nThe proposed model achieves an accuracy of 90% and outperforms traditional machine learning models. We also present a comparison of the proposed model with state-of-the-art models.\n\n**4. Discussion**\n\nThe proposed model demonstrates the effectiveness of deep learning techniques for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity. The CNN-RNN hybrid model leverages the strengths of both architectures to improve the accuracy of binding affinity predictions.\n\n**5. Conclusion**\n\nIn conclusion, our novel deep learning-based approach for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity achieves state-of-the-art results and demonstrates the potential of deep learning techniques for protein-ligand binding affinity predictions.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. The authors present a novel approach that combines the strengths of CNN and RNN to predict protein-ligand binding affinity.\n2. The proposed model achieves an accuracy of 90%, which is competitive with state-of-the-art models.\n3. The authors provide a thorough discussion of the results and potential limitations of the proposed approach.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. The dataset used is relatively small (10,000 protein-ligand binding interactions), which may not be representative of the entire protein-ligand binding landscape.\n2. The feature engineering step is not explicitly described, which may lead to potential biases and limitations.\n3.

        "abstract": "Learning Rate Rewinding (LRR) has been established as a strong variant of Iterative Magnitude Pruning (IMP) to find lottery tickets in deep overparameterized neural networks. While both iterative pruning schemes couple structure and parameter learning, understanding how LRR excels in both aspects can bring us closer to the design of more flexible deep learning algorithms that can optimize diverse sets of sparse architectures. To this end, we conduct experiments that disentangle the effect of mask learning and parameter optimization and how both benefit from overparameterization. The ability of LRR to flip parameter signs early and stay robust to sign perturbations seems to make it not only more effective in mask identification but also in optimizing diverse sets of masks, including random ones. In support of this hypothesis, we prove in a simplified single hidden neuron setting that LRR succeeds in more cases than IMP, as it can escape initially problematic sign configurations.",

The experiment was conducted using 120 wheat plants, divided into six treatment groups, each with 20 plants. The temperature treatments were: (1) control (20\u00b0C), (2) high temperature (30\u00b0C), (3) moderate temperature (25\u00b0C), (4) low temperature (18\u00b0C), (5) alternating temperature (20\u00b0C/25\u00b0C/30\u00b0C), (6) temperature fluctuation (20\u00b0C/30\u00b0C/18\u00b0C). The plants were grown for 120 days. Growth performance was measured using yield, biomass, plant height, leaf area, water uptake, and root length.\n\nThe results showed that temperature fluctuations had significant effects on growth performance of wheat. The alternating temperature treatment resulted in maximum yield (4560 kg/ha), followed by moderate temperature (3840 kg/ha). The high temperature treatment resulted in significant reductions in yield (3360 kg/ha), while low temperature treatment resulted in significant reductions in biomass (1720 kg/ha). Temperature fluctuations had significant effects on plant growth, leaf area, water uptake, and root length.\n\nThe study suggests that temperature fluctuations can be used as an effective tool for improving growth performance of wheat. However, further studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of temperature fluctuations on wheat growth.\n\n**Critical Peer Review:**\n\nThe study investigates the effects of different temperature regimens on growth performance of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.). The experiment was conducted using 120 wheat plants, divided into six treatment groups, each with 20 plants. The temperature treatments were: (1) control (20\u00b0C), (2) high temperature (30\u00b0C), (3) moderate temperature (25\u00b0C), (4) low temperature (18\u00b0C), (5) alternating temperature (20\u00b0C/25\u00b0C/30\u00b0C), (6) temperature fluctuation (20\u00b0C/30\u00b0C/18\u00b0C). The plants were grown for 120 days. Growth performance was measured using yield, biomass, plant height, leaf area, water uptake, and root length.\n\nThe study's design is well-structured, with six treatment groups that cover various temperature scenarios. However, there are some concerns regarding sample size. A larger sample size would provide more reliable results, especially considering that only 20 plants were used per treatment group. Furthermore, it is essential to consider potential confounding variables, such as soil type, nutrient availability, or pest/disease pressures, which could influence growth performance.\n\nThe results showed that temperature fluctuations had significant effects on growth performance of wheat. The alternating temperature treatment resulted in maximum yield (4560 kg/ha), followed by moderate temperature (3840 kg/ha). The high temperature treatment resulted in significant reductions in yield (3360 kg/ha), while low temperature treatment resulted in significant reductions in biomass (1720 kg/ha). Temperature fluctuations had significant effects on plant growth, leaf area, water uptake, and root length.\n\nThe study's conclusions are supported by the data, but there are some concerns regarding statistical analysis. The authors used ANOVA to compare treatment means, but did not provide p-values or F-values. Additionally, some of the results seem to be inconsistent with general knowledge about plant growth. For example, high temperature treatment typically results in increased growth rates, not decreased yield.\n\nTo strengthen this study, I recommend:\n\n1. Increasing sample size to 100-200 plants per treatment group to reduce variability.\n2. Including additional measurements, such as soil type, nutrient availability, or pest/disease pressures, to account for potential confounding variables.\n3. Using more robust statistical analysis, such as linear mixed effects modeling, to account for potential non-independence of observations.\n4. Providing p-values or F-values to support statistical claims.\n5. Carefully reviewing results for consistency with general knowledge about plant growth.\n\nOverall, this study highlights the importance of temperature fluctuations in improving growth performance of wheat. However, further studies are needed to understand the underlying mechanisms of temperature fluctuations on wheat growth.",

        "abstract": "Zero-shot learning in prompted vision-language models, the practice of crafting prompts to build classifiers without an explicit training process, has achieved impressive performance in many settings. This success presents a seemingly surprising observation: these methods suffer relatively little from overfitting, i.e., when a prompt is manually engineered to achieve low error on a given training set (thus rendering the method no longer actually zero-shot), the approach still performs well on held-out test data. In this paper, we show that we can explain such performance well via recourse to classical PAC-Bayes bounds. Specifically, we show that the discrete nature of prompts, combined with a PAC-Bayes prior given by a language model, results in generalization bounds that are remarkably tight by the standards of the literature: for instance, the generalization bound of an ImageNet classifier is often within a few percentage points of the true test error. We demonstrate empirically that this holds for existing handcrafted prompts and prompts generated through simple greedy search. Furthermore, the resulting bound is well-suited for model selection: the models with the best bound typically also have the best test performance. This work thus provides a possible justification for the widespread practice of \u201cprompt engineering,\u201d even if it seems that such methods could potentially overfit the training data.",

        "abstract": "Pretrained large language models (LLMs) are general purpose problem solvers applicable to a diverse set of tasks with prompts. They can be further improved towards a specific task by fine-tuning on a specialized dataset. However, fine-tuning usually makes the model narrowly specialized on this dataset with reduced general in-context learning performances, which is undesirable whenever the fine-tuned model needs to handle additional tasks where no fine-tuning data is available. In this work, we first demonstrate that fine-tuning on a single task indeed decreases LLMs\u2019 general in-context learning performance. We discover one important cause of such forgetting, format specialization, where the model overfits to the format of the fine-tuned task. We further show that format specialization happens at the very beginning of fine-tuning. To solve this problem, we propose Prompt Tuning with MOdel Tuning (ProMoT), a simple yet effective two-stage fine-tuning framework that reduces format specialization and improves generalization. ProMoT offloads task-specific format learning into additional and removable parameters by first doing prompt tuning and then fine-tuning the model itself with this soft prompt attached. With experiments on several fine-tuning tasks and 8 in-context evaluation tasks, we show that ProMoT achieves comparable performance on fine-tuned tasks to standard fine-tuning, but with much less loss of in-context learning performances across a board range of out-of-domain evaluation tasks. More importantly, ProMoT can even enhance generalization on in-context learning tasks that are semantically related to the fine-tuned task, e.g. ProMoT on En-Fr translation significantly improves performance on other language pairs, and ProMoT on NLI improves performance on summarization. Experiments also show that ProMoT can improve the generalization performance of multi-task training.",

        "abstract": "We study both stream-based and pool-based active learning with neural network approximations. A recent line of works proposed bandit-based approaches that transformed active learning into a bandit problem, achieving both theoretical and empirical success. However, the performance and computational costs of these methods may be susceptible to the number of classes, denoted as K, due to this transformation. Therefore, this paper seeks to answer the question: \"How can we mitigate the adverse impacts of K while retaining the advantages of principled exploration and provable performance guarantees in active learning?\" To tackle this challenge, we propose two algorithms based on the newly designed exploitation and exploration neural networks for stream-based and pool-based active learning. Subsequently, we provide theoretical performance guarantees for both algorithms in a non-parametric setting, demonstrating a slower error-growth rate concerning K for the proposed approaches. We use extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed algorithms, which consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines.",

        "title": "ZERO-SHOT GENERALIZATION IN VISION-LANGUAGE MODELS",
        "abstract": "One fascinating aspect of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) learning under language supervision is their impressive zero-shot generalization capability. However, this ability is hindered by distribution shifts between the training and testing data. Previous test time adaptation (TTA) methods for VLMs in zeroshot classification rely on minimizing the entropy of model outputs, tending to be stuck in incorrect model predictions. In this work, we propose TTA with feedback to rectify the model output and prevent the model from becoming blindly confident. Specifically, a CLIP model is adopted as the reward model during TTA and provides feedback for the VLM. Given a single test sample, the VLM is forced to maximize the CLIP reward between the input and sampled results from the VLM output distribution. The proposed reinforcement learning with CLIP feedback (RLCF) framework is highly flexible and universal. Beyond the classification task, with task-specific sampling strategies and a proper reward baseline choice, RLCF can be easily extended to not only discrimination tasks like retrieval but also generalization tasks like image captioning, improving the zero-shot generalization capacity of VLMs. According to the characteristics of these VL tasks, we build different fully TTA pipelines with RLCF to improve the zero-shot generalization ability of various VLMs. Extensive experiments along with promising empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of RLCF.

        "abstract": "Vision-language models such as CLIP have shown great impact on diverse downstream tasks for zero-shot or label-free predictions. However, when it comes to low-level vision such as image restoration their performance deteriorates dramatically due to corrupted inputs. In this paper, we present a degradation-aware visionlanguage model (DA-CLIP) to better transfer pretrained vision-language models to low-level vision tasks as a multi-task framework for image restoration. More specifically, DA-CLIP trains an additional controller that adapts the fixed CLIP image encoder to predict high-quality feature embeddings. By integrating the embedding into an image restoration network via cross-attention, we are able to pilot the model to learn a high-fidelity image reconstruction. The controller itself will also output a degradation feature that matches the real corruptions of the input, yielding a natural classifier for different degradation types. In addition, we construct a mixed degradation dataset with synthetic captions for DA-CLIP training. Our approach advances state-of-the-art performance on both degradation-specific and unified image restoration tasks, showing a promising direction of prompting image restoration with large-scale pretrained vision-language models.

The findings suggest that microRNA-based gene editing has the potential to be a valuable therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nWhile the abstract provides an overview of the paper's main findings, the introduction section could benefit from more clarity and depth. The authors mention that neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's, have a significant impact on society, but the discussion of the underlying mechanisms and the current therapeutic options is lacking. Additionally, the introduction could benefit from a more detailed explanation of the microRNA-based gene editing approach and its relevance to neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**Materials and Methods:**\n\nThe materials and methods section is concise and easy to follow, but there is a lack of detail regarding the CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing protocol. The authors mention that the CRISPR-Cas9 system was used to target specific genes, but the details of the guide RNA design, the efficiency of the editing, and the potential off-target effects are not discussed. Furthermore, the in vitro and in vivo experiments were conducted using animal models, but the details of the animal models used, the experimental design, and the data analysis methods are not fully explained.\n\n**Results:**\n\nThe results section presents the main findings of the study, which include significant improvements in disease symptoms and cognitive function in animal models of Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease. However, the results could be more rigorously evaluated using statistical analysis and control experiments. The authors also mention that the approach was tested in vitro, but the details of the in vitro experiments, such as the type of cells used and the experimental design, are not fully explained.\n\n**Discussion:**\n\nThe discussion section is brief and lacks depth.

        "abstract": "We introduce Lemur and Lemur-Chat, openly accessible language models optimized for both natural language and coding capabilities to serve as the backbone of versatile language agents. The evolution from language chat models to functional language agents demands that models not only master human interaction, reasoning, and planning but also ensure grounding in the relevant environments. This calls for a harmonious blend of language and coding capabilities in the models. Lemur and Lemur-Chat are proposed to address this necessity, demonstrating balanced proficiencies in both domains, unlike existing open-source models that tend to specialize in either. Through meticulous pretraining using a code-intensive corpus and instruction fine-tuning on text and code data, our models achieve state-of-the-art averaged performance across diverse text and coding benchmarks. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate Lemur\u2019s superiority over existing open-source models and its proficiency across various agent tasks involving human communication, tool usage, and interaction under fullyand partiallyobservable environments. The harmonization between natural and programming languages enables Lemur-Chat to significantly narrow the gap with proprietary models on agent abilities, providing key insights into developing advanced open-source agents adept at reasoning, planning, and operating seamlessly across environments. Our model and code have been open-sourced at https://github.com/OpenLemur/Lemur.",

        "abstract": "Federated semi-supervised learning (FSSL) has emerged as a powerful paradigm for collaboratively training machine learning models using distributed data with label deficiency. Advanced FSSL methods predominantly focus on training a single model on each client. However, this approach could lead to a discrepancy between the objective functions of labeled and unlabeled data, resulting in gradient conflicts. To alleviate gradient conflict, we propose a novel twin-model paradigm, called Twin-sight, designed to enhance mutual guidance by providing insights from different perspectives of labeled and unlabeled data. In particular, Twin-sight concurrently trains a supervised model with a supervised objective function while training an unsupervised model using an unsupervised objective function. To enhance the synergy between these two models, Twin-sight introduces a neighbourhood-preserving constraint, which encourages the preservation of the neighbourhood relationship among data features extracted by both models. Our comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets provide substantial evidence that Twin-sight can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods across various experimental settings, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed Twin-sight.

        "abstract": "Optimization layers within neural network architectures have become increasingly popular for their ability to solve a wide range of machine learning tasks and to model domain-specific knowledge. However, designing optimization layers requires careful consideration as the underlying optimization problems might be infeasible during training. Motivated by applications in learning, control and robotics, this work focuses on convex quadratic programming (QP) layers. The specific structure of this type of optimization layer can be efficiently exploited for faster computations while still allowing rich modeling capabilities. We leverage primal-dual augmented Lagrangian techniques for computing derivatives of both feasible and infeasible QP solutions. More precisely, we propose a unified approach that tackles the differentiability of the closest feasible QP solutions in a classical l2 sense. The obtained Jacobian covers for feasible QPs the traditional implicit differentiation when it is valid and a weaker notion (i.e., conservative Jacobian) when it is infeasible. We then harness this approach to enrich the expressive capabilities of existing QP layers. More precisely, we show how differentiating through infeasible QPs during training enables to drive towards feasibility at test time a new range of QP layers. These layers notably demonstrate superior predictive performance in some conventional learning tasks. Additionally, we present alternative formulations that enhance numerical robustness, speed, and accuracy for training such layers. Along with these contributions, we provide an open-source C++ software package called QPLayer for differentiating feasible and infeasible convex QPs and which can be interfaced with modern learning frameworks.",

They analyzed over 500 articles and studies to determine how different factors, such as platform type (social media vs. traditional media), advertising format (image vs. text-based), and demographic characteristics, impact consumer behavior.\n\nThe results showed that consumers exhibit distinct behaviors when interacting with advertisements on different platforms. For instance, consumers on Instagram exhibit different behavior patterns compared to those on Facebook. Moreover, consumers with higher levels of education and socio-economic status exhibit different attitudes towards advertising.\n\nThe researchers also found that certain advertising formats are more effective than others in influencing consumer behavior. Image-based advertisements, for instance, have been shown to be more effective in influencing consumer behavior than text-based advertisements.\n\nThe conclusions drawn from this systematic review suggest that consumers play a significant role in shaping consumer behavior through various means, including interacting with advertisements on social media platforms. These findings have implications for marketers and advertisers, as they can use this knowledge to tailor advertising strategies to specific consumer demographics and behaviors.\n\nPeer Review:\n\nThe article provides a comprehensive and systematic review of existing literature on consumer behavior and its relationship with social media. However, there are some limitations and areas for improvement that need to be addressed.\n\nStrengths:\n\n* The article provides a clear and concise overview of the existing literature on consumer behavior and its relationship with social media.\n* The use of a mixed-methods approach allows for a comprehensive understanding of consumer behavior and its various aspects.\n* The findings of this systematic review have significant implications for marketers and advertisers.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n* One of the main limitations of this systematic review is that it only includes studies that have been previously conducted. This means that there are gaps in the literature that are not addressed in this review.\n* There are also limitations in terms of sample size and demographics. Many of the studies included in this review are limited to specific populations, such as college-aged individuals or those from developed countries.\n* Another limitation of this review is that it only explores a limited range of advertising formats, such as image-based and text-based advertisements.\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n\n* To address these limitations, future studies should aim to include a broader range of studies, including those that have not been previously conducted.\n* Future studies should also aim to increase sample sizes and demographics, including those from underrepresented populations.\n* Future studies should also explore a wider range of advertising formats, including those that are more innovative and emerging.\n\nCritique:\n\nThe article provides a thorough and comprehensive review of existing literature on consumer behavior and its relationship with social media. However, there are some limitations and areas for improvement that need to be addressed.\n\nThe researchers demonstrate a clear understanding of consumer behavior and its various aspects, including purchasing decisions, brand perception, and attitudes towards advertising. They also demonstrate a thorough understanding of how consumers interact with and respond to advertisements on various platforms.\n\nHowever, there are some limitations to this systematic review that need to be addressed. For instance, many of the studies included in this review are limited to specific populations, such as college-aged individuals or those from developed countries. Future studies should aim to include a broader range of studies, including those that have not been previously conducted.\n\nAdditionally, this systematic review only explores a limited range of advertising formats, such as image-based and text-based advertisements.

        "abstract": "The full potential of large pretrained models remains largely untapped in control domains like robotics. This is mainly due to data scarcity and computational challenges associated with training or fine-tuning large models for such applications. Prior work mainly emphasizes either effective pretraining of large models for decision-making or single-task adaptation. But real-world problems will require data-efficient, continual adaptation for new control tasks. Recognizing these constraints, we introduce TAIL (Task-specific Adapters for Imitation Learning), a framework for efficient adaptation to a stream of new control tasks. Inspired by recent advancements in parameter-efficient fine-tuning in language domains, we explore efficient fine-tuning techniques\u2014e.g., Bottleneck Adapters, P-Tuning, and Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)\u2014in TAIL to adapt large pretrained models for new tasks with limited demonstration data. Our extensive experiments comparing prevalent parameter-efficient fine-tuning techniques and adaptation baselines suggest that TAIL with LoRA can achieve the best post-adaptation performance with only 1% of the trainable parameters of full fine-tuning while avoiding catastrophic forgetting and preserving adaptation plasticity in continual learning settings.",

The authors conducted a comparative study using three distinct temperature regimes: optimal, moderate, and extreme. The results show that optimal temperature (25\u00b0C) promotes healthy plant growth and maximum yield, while moderate temperature (20\u00b0C) results in moderate growth and yield, and extreme temperature (30\u00b0C) negatively affects plant growth and yield. The study highlights the importance of maintaining optimal temperature for plant growth and productivity.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Overall Impression:**\n\nThe study presents a well-structured and well-executed research design, with a clear objective and methodology. The authors provide a thorough analysis of their results, and their conclusions are supported by empirical evidence. However, there are some limitations and areas for improvement that I will address below.\n\n**Methodology:**\n\nThe study employed a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with three temperature regimes: optimal (25\u00b0C), moderate (20\u00b0C), and extreme (30\u00b0C). The experiment was conducted over a period of 6 weeks, with 10 replicates for each temperature regime. The authors measured plant height, leaf area, and yield using standard methods. However, I would have liked to see more detail on the experimental setup, including information on soil type, nutrient levels, and irrigation schedule.\n\n**Results:**\n\nThe results show a clear trend of optimal temperature (25\u00b0C) promoting healthy plant growth and maximum yield, while moderate temperature (20\u00b0C) results in moderate growth and yield, and extreme temperature (30\u00b0C) negatively affects plant growth and yield. The authors also report a statistically significant difference (p < 0.05) between temperature regimes, which is consistent with their hypotheses.\n\n**Discussion:**\n\nThe discussion is clear and concise, and the authors provide a thorough analysis of their results. However, I would have liked to see more discussion on potential limitations and sources of error. For example, what was done to control for other environmental factors that may have affected plant growth and yield?\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe study concludes that optimal temperature (25\u00b0C) is essential for plant growth and productivity, and that maintaining optimal temperature is crucial for maximizing yield. The authors also highlight the importance of considering temperature regimes when designing agricultural systems.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n\n1. **More detail on experimental setup:** I would have liked to see more information on soil type, nutrient levels, and irrigation schedule, which could have provided more insight into potential sources of error.\n2. **More replicates:** The study had only 10 replicates for each temperature regime, which may not have been sufficient to capture all sources of variation. Increasing replicates to 15 or 20 would have provided more robust results.\n3. **Control for other environmental factors:** The authors did not control for other environmental factors that may have affected plant growth and yield, such as light, CO2 levels, and soil moisture. This could have introduced bias into their results.\n4. **More detailed analysis of yield data:** The authors only reported yield data, without providing more detailed analysis of yield components (e.g., grain yield, protein content, etc.). This could have provided more insight into how temperature regimes affected plant growth and productivity.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\nBased on this peer review, I would recommend that the authors revise their manuscript to address these limitations and areas for improvement. Specifically, they should:\n\n* Provide more detail on experimental setup, including information on soil type, nutrient levels, and irrigation schedule.\n* Increase replicates to 15 or 20 to provide more robust results.\n* Control for other environmental factors that may have affected plant growth and yield.\n* Provide more detailed analysis of yield data, including yield components.\n\nOverall, this study presents a well-structured and well-executed research design, with clear conclusions and empirical evidence. With revisions to address these limitations and areas for improvement, this study has the potential to contribute meaningfully to our understanding of temperature regimes and plant growth and productivity.",

        "abstract": "Lattices are architected metamaterials whose properties strongly depend on their geometrical design. The analogy between lattices and graphs enables the use of graph neural networks (GNNs) as a faster surrogate model compared to traditional methods such as finite element modeling. In this work, we generate a big dataset of structure-property relationships for strut-based lattices. The dataset is made available to the community which can fuel the development of methods anchored in physical principles for the fitting of fourth-order tensors. In addition, we present a higher-order GNN model trained on this dataset. The key features of the model are (i) SE(3) equivariance, and (ii) consistency with the thermodynamic law of conservation of energy. We compare the model to non-equivariant models based on a number of error metrics and demonstrate its benefits in terms of predictive performance and reduced training requirements. Finally, we demonstrate an example application of the model to an architected material design task. The methods which we developed are applicable to fourth-order tensors beyond elasticity such as piezo-optical tensor etc.",

Smith\n* M. Johnson\n* T. Lee\n* E. Brown\n\nAbstract:\nThis paper proposes a machine learning framework for optimal resource allocation in multi-agent systems. The proposed framework utilizes reinforcement learning and Q-learning to optimize the allocation of resources among agents. The framework consists of three main modules: (1) agent modeling module; (2) resource allocation module; and (3) optimization module. The agent modeling module uses a combination of machine learning algorithms to model the behavior and decision-making processes of agents. The resource allocation module uses the output from the agent modeling module to allocate resources among agents. The optimization module uses reinforcement learning to optimize the allocation of resources among agents. The proposed framework has been tested on a simulated multi-agent system with 50 agents and has shown promising results.\n\nIntroduction:\nMulti-agent systems are becoming increasingly popular in various fields such as robotics, finance, and logistics. In these systems, multiple agents are interacting with each other and their environment to achieve a common goal. However, optimizing the allocation of resources among agents in multi-agent systems can be a challenging task. Traditional methods for resource allocation in multi-agent systems rely on manual intervention and do not take into account the complex dynamics and interactions between agents.\n\nThe proposed framework uses reinforcement learning and Q-learning to optimize the resource allocation among agents. The reinforcement learning algorithm is used to learn the optimal policy for resource allocation from trial and error. The Q-learning algorithm uses the state-action values (Q-values) to estimate the desirability of taking a particular action in a given state. The proposed framework has the advantage of being able to adapt to changing conditions and learn from experience.\n\nDiscussion:\nThe proposed framework has shown promising results in the simulated multi-agent system. The results have demonstrated that the proposed framework can optimize the allocation of resources among agents and improve the overall performance of the multi-agent system. The framework has also shown that the resource allocation can be optimized even in the presence of uncertainty and noise.\n\nConclusion:\nIn conclusion, the proposed framework has shown promising results in optimizing the resource allocation among agents in multi-agent systems. The framework has the advantage of being able to adapt to changing conditions and learn from experience. The proposed framework has the potential to be used in various fields such as robotics and finance.\n\nPeer Review:\n**Overall Impression:**\nThe paper proposes a machine learning framework for optimal resource allocation in multi-agent systems.

        "abstract": "Vertical federated learning (VFL), where each participating client holds a subset of data features, has found numerous applications in finance, healthcare, and IoT systems. However, adversarial attacks, particularly through the injection of adversarial examples (AEs), pose serious challenges to the security of VFL models. In this paper, we investigate such vulnerabilities through developing a novel attack to disrupt the VFL inference process, under a practical scenario where the adversary is able to adaptively corrupt a subset of clients. We formulate the problem of finding optimal attack strategies as an online optimization problem, which is decomposed into an inner problem of adversarial example generation (AEG) and an outer problem of corruption pattern selection (CPS). Specifically, we establish the equivalence between the formulated CPS problem and a multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, and propose the Thompson sampling with Empirical maximum reward (E-TS) algorithm for the adversary to efficiently identify the optimal subset of clients for corruption. The key idea of E-TS is to introduce an estimation of the expected maximum reward for each arm, which helps to specify a small set of competitive arms, on which the exploration for the optimal arm is performed. This significantly reduces the exploration space, which otherwise can quickly become prohibitively large as the number of clients increases. We analytically characterize the regret bound of E-TS, and empirically demonstrate its capability of efficiently revealing the optimal corruption pattern with the highest attack success rate, under various datasets of popular VFL tasks.",

        "abstract": "We present chain-of-knowledge (CoK) , a novel framework that augments large language models (LLMs) by dynamically incorporating grounding information from heterogeneous sources. It results in more factual rationales and reduced hallucination in generation. Specifically, CoK consists of three stages: reasoning preparation, dynamic knowledge adapting, and answer consolidation. Given a knowledge-intensive question, CoK first prepares several preliminary rationales and answers while identifying the relevant knowledge domains. If there is no majority consensus among the answers from samples, CoK corrects the rationales step by step by adapting knowledge from the identified domains. These corrected rationales can plausibly serve as a better foundation for the final answer consolidation. Unlike prior studies that primarily use unstructured data, CoK also leverages structured knowledge sources such as Wikidata and tables that provide more reliable factual information. To access both unstructured and structured knowledge sources in the dynamic knowledge adapting stage, we propose an adaptive query generator that allows the generation of queries for various types of query languages, including SPARQL, SQL, and natural sentences. Moreover, to minimize error propagation between rationales, CoK corrects the rationales progressively using preceding corrected rationales to generate and correct subsequent rationales. Extensive experiments show that CoK consistently improves the performance of LLMs on knowledge-intensive tasks across different domains.

Three temperature regimes were created: optimal, moderate, and stressful conditions. Wheat plants were grown in controlled environments with the temperature regimes maintained for 60 days. Results showed that optimal temperature regime (25\u00b0C) produced the highest yield and best grain quality, while moderate temperature regime (22\u00b0C) produced the highest protein content. Stressful temperature regime (28\u00b0C) showed significant yield reduction and lower grain quality. \n\nIntroduction:\n\nWheat (Triticum aestivum) is one of the most widely cultivated crops in the world, with an increasing demand for high-quality wheat for various applications. Temperature is an important environmental factor that affects wheat growth and productivity. Understanding the effects of temperature on wheat yield and quality is crucial for optimizing crop management practices.\n\nMethodology:\n\nThree temperature regimes were created: optimal (25\u00b0C), moderate (22\u00b0C), and stressful (28\u00b0C). Wheat plants were grown in controlled environments with the same soil and nutrient conditions. Plants were grown for 60 days, and grain yield and quality were evaluated at harvest.\n\nResults:\n\nOptimal temperature regime (25\u00b0C) produced the highest yield (4.2 kg/m\u00b2) and best grain quality (Protein content: 12.5%, Moisture content: 10.5%), while moderate temperature regime (22\u00b0C) produced the highest protein content (14.2%) and moderate yield (3.8 kg/m\u00b2). Stressful temperature regime (28\u00b0C) showed significant yield reduction (2.3 kg/m\u00b2) and lower grain quality (Protein content: 9.2%, Moisture content: 12.5%).\n\nDiscussion:\n\nThe results of this study show that optimal temperature regime (25\u00b0C) produced the highest yield and best grain quality, while moderate temperature regime (22\u00b0C) produced the highest protein content. Stressful temperature regime (28\u00b0C) showed significant yield reduction and lower grain quality. These findings are consistent with previous studies, which have shown that optimal temperature for wheat growth is around 25\u00b0C.\n\nConclusion:\n\nThis study provides valuable insights into the effects of temperature on wheat yield and quality. Understanding the optimal temperature regime for wheat growth can inform crop management practices and improve crop productivity.\n\nPeer Review:\n\nThe study presented in this paper is well-structured, and the authors have provided clear and concise information about the methodology, results, and discussion. \n\nStrengths:\n\n*   Well-designed experiment with controlled environments to minimize external variables.\n*   Comprehensive evaluation of grain yield and quality parameters.\n*   Consistency with previous studies on optimal temperature for wheat growth.\n\nWeaknesses:\n\n*   Limited sample size (60 days) and short duration of the experiment.\n*   No consideration of other environmental factors such as light, water, and nutrient availability.\n*   No discussion of potential interactions between temperature and other environmental factors.\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n\n*   Increase the duration of the experiment to 90 or 120 days to improve the accuracy of the results.\n*   Include other environmental factors such as light, water, and nutrient availability in the experiment design.\n*   Discuss potential interactions between temperature and other environmental factors.\n\nOverall, the study provides valuable insights into the effects of temperature on wheat yield and quality. With some modifications to the experiment design, the results can be more robust and generalizable.",

        "title": "HOW OVER-PARAMETERIZATION SLOWS DOWN GRA-",
        "abstract": "This paper rigorously shows how over-parameterization dramatically changes the convergence behaviors of gradient descent (GD) for the matrix sensing problem, where the goal is to recover an unknown low-rank ground-truth matrix from nearisotropic linear measurements. First, we consider the symmetric setting with the symmetric parameterization where M\u2217 \u2208 Rn\u00d7n is a positive semi-definite unknown matrix of rank r \u226a n, and one uses a symmetric parameterization XX\u22a4 to learn M\u2217. Here, X \u2208 Rn\u00d7k with k > r is the factor matrix. We give a novel \u03a9 ( 1/T 2 ) lower bound of randomly initialized GD for the over-parameterized case (k > r) where T is the number of iterations. This is in stark contrast to the exact-parameterization scenario (k = r) where the convergence rate is exp (\u2212\u03a9 (T )). Next, we study asymmetric setting where M\u2217 \u2208 Rn1\u00d7n2 is the unknown matrix of rank r \u226a min{n1, n2}, and one uses an asymmetric parameterization FG\u22a4 to learn M\u2217 where F \u2208 Rn1\u00d7k and G \u2208 Rn2\u00d7k. Building on prior work, we give a global exact convergence result of randomly initialized GD for the exact-parameterization case (k = r) with an exp (\u2212\u03a9 (T )) rate. Furthermore, we give the first global exact convergence result for the over-parameterization case (k > r) with an exp ( \u2212\u03a9 ( \u03b1T )) rate where \u03b1 is the initialization scale. This linear convergence result in the over-parameterization case is especially significant because one can apply the asymmetric parameterization to the symmetric setting to speed up from \u03a9 ( 1/T 2 ) to linear convergence. Therefore, we identify a surprising phenomenon: asymmetric parameterization can exponentially speed up convergence. Equally surprising is our analysis that highlights the importance of imbalance between F and G. This is in sharp contrast to prior works which emphasize balance. We further give an example showing the dependency on \u03b1 in the convergence rate is unavoidable in the worst case. On the other hand, we propose a novel method that only modifies one step of GD and obtains a convergence rate independent of \u03b1, recovering the rate in the exact-parameterization case. We provide empirical studies to verify our theoretical findings.",

        "abstract": "Language model (LM) prompting\u2014a popular paradigm for solving NLP tasks\u2014 has been shown to be susceptible to miscalibration and brittleness to slight prompt variations, caused by its discriminative prompting approach, i.e., predicting the label given the input. To address these issues, we propose GEN-Z\u2014a generative prompting framework for zero-shot text classification. GEN-Z is generative, as it measures the LM likelihood of input text, conditioned on natural language descriptions of labels. The framework is multivariate, as label descriptions allow us to seamlessly integrate additional contextual information about the labels to improve task performance. On various standard classification benchmarks, with six open-source LM families, we show that zero-shot classification with simple contextualization of the data source of the evaluation set consistently outperforms both zero-shot and few-shot baselines while improving robustness to prompt variations. Further, our approach enables personalizing classification in a zero-shot manner by incorporating author, subject, or reader information in the label descriptions.",

We formally analyze FOSI\u2019s convergence and the conditions under which it improves a base optimizer.

        "title": "SELF-SUPERVISED CONTRASTIVE FORECASTING",
        "abstract": "Long-term forecasting presents unique challenges due to the time and memory complexity of handling long sequences. Existing methods, which rely on sliding windows to process long sequences, struggle to effectively capture long-term variations that are partially caught within the short window (i.e., outer-window variations). In this paper, we introduce a novel approach that overcomes this limitation by employing contrastive learning and enhanced decomposition architecture, specifically designed to focus on long-term variations. To this end, our contrastive loss incorporates global autocorrelation held in the whole time series, which facilitates the construction of positive and negative pairs in a self-supervised manner. When combined with our decomposition networks, our contrastive learning significantly improves long-term forecasting performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms 14 baseline models in multiple experiments over nine long-term benchmarks, especially in challenging scenarios that require a significantly long output for forecasting.

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) for complex tasks remains a challenge, primarily due to the difficulties of engineering scalar reward functions and the inherent inefficiency of training models from scratch. Instead, it would be better to specify complex tasks in terms of elementary subtasks and to reuse subtask solutions whenever possible. In this work, we address continuous space lexicographic multi-objective RL problems, consisting of prioritized subtasks, which are notoriously difficult to solve. We show that these can be scalarized with a subtask transformation and then solved incrementally using value decomposition. Exploiting this insight, we propose prioritized soft Q-decomposition (PSQD), a novel algorithm for learning and adapting subtask solutions under lexicographic priorities in continuous state-action spaces. PSQD offers the ability to reuse previously learned subtask solutions in a zero-shot composition, followed by an adaptation step. Its ability to use retained subtask training data for offline learning eliminates the need for new environment interaction during adaptation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by presenting successful learning, reuse, and adaptation results for both lowand high-dimensional simulated robot control tasks, as well as offline learning results. In contrast to baseline approaches, PSQD does not trade off between conflicting subtasks or priority constraints and satisfies subtask priorities during learning. PSQD provides an intuitive framework for tackling complex RL problems, offering insights into the inner workings of the subtask composition.",

Hyperbolic neural networks (HNNs) are a promising approach for learning feature representations in such spaces. However, current HNNs in computer vision rely on Euclidean backbones and only project features to the hyperbolic space in the task heads, limiting their ability to fully leverage the benefits of hyperbolic geometry. To address this, we present HCNN, a fully hyperbolic convolutional neural network (CNN) designed for computer vision tasks. Based on the Lorentz model, we generalize fundamental components of CNNs and propose novel formulations of the convolutional layer, batch normalization, and multinomial logistic regression. Experiments on standard vision tasks demonstrate the promising performance of our HCNN framework in both hybrid and fully hyperbolic settings. Overall, we believe our contributions provide a foundation for developing more powerful HNNs that can better represent complex structures found in image data.

We designed a system that utilizes CRISPR-Cas13 to target specific microRNAs associated with NDs, leading to the silencing of disease-causing genes. Our preclinical studies demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in models of Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS). These studies show that microRNA-based gene editing can effectively reduce disease symptoms, slow disease progression, and promote neuroregeneration.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nNeurodegenerative disorders are a major cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) are among the most prevalent NDs. Current therapeutic approaches have limitations, including poor efficacy, significant side effects, and limited understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play a crucial role in regulating gene expression, and aberrant miRNA expression has been implicated in NDs. We hypothesize that targeting specific miRNAs associated with NDs using CRISPR-Cas13 gene editing can provide a novel therapeutic strategy for treating NDs.\n\n**Methods:**\n\nOur research team designed a system that utilizes CRISPR-Cas13 to target specific miRNAs associated with NDs. We identified 10 miRNAs that are differentially expressed in ND models using RNA sequencing. These miRNAs were validated using qRT-PCR. We then designed CRISPR-Cas13 guide RNAs (gRNAs) to target these miRNAs. The gRNAs were introduced into human neuroepithelial cells (hNECs) using a viral vector. We then assessed the efficacy of CRISPR-Cas13 gene editing in silencing disease-causing genes.\n\n**Results:**\n\nOur preclinical studies demonstrated that CRISPR-Cas13 gene editing effectively silenced disease-causing genes in hNECs. The silencing of these genes resulted in reduced disease symptoms, slower disease progression, and increased neuroregeneration. We also observed a significant increase in the expression of miRNAs that are associated with neuroregeneration.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nOur research presents a novel therapeutic strategy for treating NDs using microRNA-based gene editing. The preclinical studies demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in models of Alzheimer's disease, Huntington's disease, and ALS.

        "abstract": "This work summarizes two ways to accomplish Time-Series (TS) tasks in today\u2019s Large Language Model (LLM) context: LLM-for-TS (model-centric) designs and trains a fundamental large model, or fine-tunes a pre-trained LLM for TS data; TS-for-LLM (data-centric) converts TS into a model-friendly representation to enable the pre-trained LLM to handle TS data. Given the lack of data, limited resources, semantic context requirements, and so on, this work focuses on TSfor-LLM, where we aim to activate LLM\u2019s ability for TS data by designing a TS embedding method suitable for LLM. The proposed method is named TEST. It first tokenizes TS, builds an encoder to embed TS via instance-wise, feature-wise, and text-prototype-aligned contrast, where the TS embedding space is aligned to LLM\u2019s embedding layer space, then creates soft prompts to make LLM more open to that embeddings, and finally implements TS tasks using the frozen LLM. We also demonstrate the feasibility of TS-for-LLM through theory and experiments. Experiments are carried out on TS classification, forecasting, and representation tasks using eight frozen LLMs with various structures and sizes. The results show that the pre-trained LLM with TEST strategy can achieve better or comparable performance than today\u2019s SOTA TS models and offer benefits for few-shot and generalization. By treating LLM as the pattern machine, TEST can endow LLM\u2019s ability to process TS data without compromising language ability. We hope that this study will serve as a foundation for future work to support TS+LLM progress.",

        "abstract": "Transparent machine learning (ML) models are essential for ensuring interpretability and trustworthiness in decision-making systems, particularly in highstakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. While transparent machine learning models have been proposed for classification and regression, time series forecasting presents some unique challenges for ensuring transparency. In particular, currently used bottom-up approaches that focus on the values of the time series at specific time points (usually regularly spaced) do not provide a holistic understanding of the entire time series. This limits the applicability of ML in many critical areas. To open up these domains for ML, we propose a top-down framework of bi-level transparency, which involves understanding the higher-level trends and the lower-level properties of the predicted time series. Applying this framework, we develop TIMEVIEW, a transparent ML model for time series forecasting based on static features, complemented with an interactive visualization tool. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy and interpretability of our approach, paving the way for more transparent and reliable applications of ML in various domains.",

        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enhances data privacy with collaborative in-situ training on decentralized clients. Nevertheless, FL encounters challenges due to nonindependent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d) data, leading to potential performance degradation and hindered convergence. While prior studies predominantly addressed the issue of skewed label distribution, our research addresses a crucial yet frequently overlooked problem known as multi-domain FL. In this scenario, clients\u2019 data originate from diverse domains with distinct feature distributions, instead of label distributions. To address the multi-domain problem in FL, we propose a novel method called Federated learning Without normalizations (FedWon). FedWon draws inspiration from the observation that batch normalization (BN) faces challenges in effectively modeling the statistics of multiple domains, while existing normalization techniques possess their own limitations. In order to address these issues, FedWon eliminates the normalization layers in FL and reparameterizes convolution layers with scaled weight standardization. Through extensive experimentation on five datasets and five models, our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FedWon surpasses both FedAvg and the current state-of-the-art method (FedBN) across all experimental setups, achieving notable accuracy improvements of more than 10% in certain domains. Furthermore, FedWon is versatile for both cross-silo and cross-device FL, exhibiting robust domain generalization capability, showcasing strong performance even with a batch size as small as 1, thereby catering to resource-constrained devices. Additionally, FedWon can also effectively tackle the challenge of skewed label distribution.",

Existing methods often resort to training cascaded models in pixel space, or using a downsampled latent space of a separately trained auto-encoder. In this paper, we introduce Matryoshka Diffusion (MDM), a novel framework for high-resolution image and video synthesis. We propose a diffusion process that denoises inputs at multiple resolutions jointly and uses a NestedUNet architecture where features and parameters for small scale inputs are nested within those of the large scales. In addition, MDM enables a progressive training schedule from lower to higher resolutions which leads to significant improvements in optimization for high-resolution generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various benchmarks, including class-conditioned image generation, high-resolution text-to-image, and text-to-video applications. Remarkably, we can train a single pixel-space model at resolutions of up to 1024 \u00d7 1024 pixels, demonstrating strong zero shot generalization using the CC12M dataset, which contains only 12 million images.",

The proposed algorithm uses a convolutional neural network (CNN) to analyze technical indicators such as moving averages and relative strength index (RSI). The results show that the algorithm outperforms traditional methods of technical analysis and machine learning models. The findings of this study contribute to the development of a more accurate and efficient method of predicting stock market trends.\n\n**Full Paper:**\n\nThe paper begins by introducing the importance of predicting stock market trends and the limitations of traditional methods of technical analysis. The authors propose a novel algorithm that combines machine learning and technical analysis to address these limitations. The algorithm consists of three stages: data preprocessing, feature extraction using CNNs, and prediction using a support vector machine (SVM) model.\n\nThe data preprocessing stage involves cleaning and normalizing the data to prepare it for analysis. The feature extraction stage uses CNNs to analyze technical indicators such as moving averages and RSI. The prediction stage uses an SVM model to make predictions based on the features extracted in the previous stage.\n\nThe authors report the results of their experiments using a dataset of stock prices and technical indicators. The results show that the proposed algorithm outperforms traditional methods of technical analysis and machine learning models. The algorithm achieves an accuracy of 85.6% in predicting stock market trends.\n\nThe authors also discuss the limitations of their study and potential avenues for future research. They note that the algorithm may not perform well in real-time applications due to the time it takes to train the CNNs. They also note that the algorithm may not be effective in predicting short-term market movements.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\nOverall, the paper presents a novel approach to predicting stock market trends using machine learning and technical analysis.

        "abstract": "This paper introduces GenCorres, a novel unsupervised joint shape matching (JSM) approach. Our key idea is to learn a mesh generator to fit an unorganized deformable shape collection while constraining deformations between adjacent synthetic shapes to preserve geometric structures such as local rigidity and local conformality. GenCorres presents three appealing advantages over existing JSM techniques. First, GenCorres performs JSM among a synthetic shape collection whose size is much bigger than the input shapes and fully leverages the datadriven power of JSM. Second, GenCorres unifies consistent shape matching and pairwise matching (i.e., by enforcing deformation priors between adjacent synthetic shapes). Third, the generator provides a concise encoding of consistent shape correspondences. However, learning a mesh generator from an unorganized shape collection is challenging, requiring a good initialization. GenCorres addresses this issue by learning an implicit generator from the input shapes, which provides intermediate shapes between two arbitrary shapes. We introduce a novel approach for computing correspondences between adjacent implicit surfaces, which we use to regularize the implicit generator. Synthetic shapes of the implicit generator then guide initial fittings (i.e., via template-based deformation) for learning the mesh generator. Experimental results show that GenCorres considerably outperforms state-of-the-art JSM techniques. The synthetic shapes of GenCorres also achieve salient performance gains against state-of-the-art deformable shape generators.",

        "abstract": "Universal domain adaptation aims to align the classes and reduce the feature gap between the same category of the source and target domains. The target private category is set as the unknown class during the adaptation process, as it is not included in the source domain. However, most existing methods overlook the intra-class structure within a category, especially in cases where there exists significant concept shift between the samples belonging to the same category. When samples with large concept shifts are forced to be pushed together, it may negatively affect the adaptation performance. Moreover, from the interpretability aspect, it is unreasonable to align visual features with significant differences, such as fighter jets and civil aircraft, into the same category. Unfortunately, due to such semantic ambiguity and annotation cost, categories are not always classified in detail, making it difficult for the model to perform precise adaptation. To address these issues, we propose a novel Memory-Assisted Sub-Prototype Mining (MemSPM) method that can learn the differences between samples belonging to the same category and mine sub-classes when there exists significant concept shift between them. By doing so, our model learns a more reasonable feature space that enhances the transferability and reflects the inherent differences among samples annotated as the same category. We evaluate the effectiveness of our MemSPM method over multiple scenarios, including UniDA, OSDA, and PDA. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks in most cases.",

        "abstract": "Previous motion generation methods are limited to the pre-rigged 3D human model, hindering their applications in the animation of various non-rigged characters. In this work, we present TapMo, a Text-driven Animation Pipeline for synthesizing Motion in a broad spectrum of skeleton-free 3D characters. The pivotal innovation in TapMo is its use of shape deformation-aware features as a condition to guide the diffusion model, thereby enabling the generation of meshspecific motions for various characters. Specifically, TapMo comprises two main components Mesh Handle Predictor and Shape-aware Diffusion Module. Mesh Handle Predictor predicts the skinning weights and clusters mesh vertices into adaptive handles for deformation control, which eliminates the need for traditional skeletal rigging. Shape-aware Motion Diffusion synthesizes motion with mesh-specific adaptations. This module employs text-guided motions and mesh features extracted during the first stage, preserving the geometric integrity of the animations by accounting for the character\u2019s shape and deformation. Trained in a weakly-supervised manner, TapMo can accommodate a multitude of nonhuman meshes, both with and without associated text motions. We demonstrate the effectiveness and generalizability of TapMo through rigorous qualitative and quantitative experiments. Our results reveal that TapMo consistently outperforms existing auto-animation methods, delivering superior-quality animations for both seen or unseen heterogeneous 3D characters.

Dr. John Doe\n2. Dr. Jane Doe\n3. Dr. Bob Johnson\n\n**Journal:**\nJournal of Computational Biology and Bioinformatics\n\n**Abstract:**\nIn this paper, we present a novel algorithm for predicting protein-ligand binding affinity using deep learning techniques. Our approach combines the advantages of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) to model the spatial and temporal relationships between protein-ligand interactions. We evaluate our method on a dataset of 100,000 protein-ligand complexes and achieve a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.23 kcal/mol, which is comparable to state-of-the-art methods. Our results suggest that our algorithm can be used for high-precision protein-ligand binding affinity predictions.\n\n**Paper Review:**\n\n**Introduction:**\nThe introduction sets the stage for the paper by highlighting the importance of protein-ligand binding affinity predictions in drug discovery and molecular biology. However, the authors could improve the clarity and concision of their explanation by providing more context and background information on the current state of protein-ligand binding affinity prediction methods.\n\n**Methods:**\nThe authors describe their approach in detail, combining CNNs and RNNs to model protein-ligand interactions. However, the explanation is often unclear and lacks technical details. For instance, the authors mention the use of convolutional layers, but do not explain the specific architecture of their CNN model. Additionally, the authors do not provide a clear explanation of how the RNNs contribute to the overall model, which is a critical aspect of their approach.\n\n**Results:**\nThe authors present their results using a dataset of 100,000 protein-ligand complexes, with a mean absolute error (MAE) of 1.23 kcal/mol. While this is an impressive result, the authors do not provide enough context to evaluate the significance of their findings. For example, how does their result compare to state-of-the-art methods? What is the range of MAE values for their dataset? Are there any limitations to their dataset that could impact the generalizability of their results?\n\n**Discussion:**\nThe authors discuss the implications of their findings, highlighting the potential of their algorithm for high-precision protein-ligand binding affinity predictions. However, the discussion is often superficial and lacks depth. For instance, the authors do not discuss the potential limitations of their approach, such as the need for a larger dataset to improve model performance.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe conclusion is a reiteration of the authors' findings, with little additional insight. While the authors do provide a clear summary of their approach and results, the paper could benefit from more technical detail and discussion of the potential limitations and future directions of their research.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\n1. Improve the clarity and concision of the introduction and methods sections.\n2. Provide more technical details about the CNN and RNN architectures used in the model.\n3. Evaluate the significance of the authors' results by comparing them to state-of-the-art methods and discussing the limitations of their dataset.\n4. Provide a more detailed discussion of the potential limitations and future directions of their research.\n\n**Rating:**\nI would rate this paper as 7/10, based on its technical quality and significance. However, I believe that with some revisions to address the above concerns, the paper could be even stronger.\n\n**Peer Reviewer:**\nDr. Emily Chen\nResearch Scientist\nDepartment of Bioinformatics\nUniversity of California, Los Angeles (UCLA)",

        "abstract": "Recently years have witnessed a rapid development of large language models (LLMs). Despite the strong ability in many language-understanding tasks, the heavy computational burden largely restricts the application of LLMs especially when one needs to deploy them onto edge devices. In this paper, we propose a quantization-aware low-rank adaptation (QA-LoRA) algorithm. The motivation lies in the imbalanced numbers of parameters for quantization and adaptation, and the solution is to use group-wise operators to increase the number of parameters for quantization meanwhile decreasing that of adaptation. QA-LoRA is easily implemented with a few lines of code, and it equips the original LoRA with two-fold abilities: (i) during fine-tuning, the LLM\u2019s weights are quantized (e.g., into INT4) to reduce time and memory usage; (ii) after fine-tuning, the LLM and auxiliary weights are naturally integrated into a quantized model without loss of accuracy. We apply QA-LoRA to the LLaMA and LLaMA2 model families and validate its effectiveness in different fine-tuning datasets and downstream scenarios.

        "abstract": "This paper presents a data-driven, task-specific paradigm for experimental design, to shorten acquisition time, reduce costs, and accelerate the deployment of imaging devices. Current approaches in experimental design focus on model-parameter estimation and require specification of a particular model, whereas in imaging, other tasks may drive the design. Furthermore, such approaches often lead to intractable optimization problems in real-world imaging applications. Here we present a new paradigm for experimental design that simultaneously optimizes the design (set of image channels) and trains a machine-learning model to execute a userspecified image-analysis task. The approach obtains data densely-sampled over the measurement space (many image channels) for a small number of acquisitions, then identifies a subset of channels of prespecified size that best supports the task. We propose a method: TADRED for TAsk-DRiven Experimental Design in imaging, to identify the most informative channel-subset whilst simultaneously training a network to execute the task given the subset. Experiments demonstrate the potential of TADRED in diverse imaging applications: several clinicallyrelevant tasks in magnetic resonance imaging; and remote sensing and physiological applications of hyperspectral imaging. Results show substantial improvement over classical experimental design, two recent application-specific methods within the new paradigm, and state-of-the-art approaches in supervised feature selection. We anticipate further applications of our approach. Code is available: Code Link.",

        "abstract": "Finetuning language models on domain-specific corpus is a common approach to enhance their domain knowledge and capability. While improving performance on domain tasks, it often brings a side-effect of forgetting of the model\u2019s general abilities. In this study, we analyze the effects of finetuning on language models by dissecting its impacts on the modeling of topic, style, and factual knowledge in text. Our method uses instruction-following LLMs such as ChatGPT to autogenerate controlled-variable text examples which we use to probe the model. Our findings reveal that finetuning results in significant shifts in the language model\u2019s topic and style priors, while actual knowledge learning only contributes to a small fraction of the total probability change. Analysis shows that the adaptation of topic and style priors behave akin to learning simple features: they are learned rapidly and require little model capacity. They are also learned independently and primarily at the beginning of a text sequence. In contrast, factual knowledge is learned stably but slowly and requires significant model capacity. The findings offer insights and understanding into the finer dynamics of learning and forgetting in language models, and potentially inform future research on improving domain adaptation and addressing the challenges of continual language learning.",

        "abstract": "Fairness in artificial intelligence models has gained significantly more attention in recent years, especially in the area of medicine, as fairness in medical models is critical to people\u2019s well-being and lives. Highquality medical fairness datasets are needed to promote fairness learning research. Existing medical fairness datasets are all for classification tasks, and no fairness datasets are available for medical segmentation, while medical segmentation is an equally important clinical task as classifications, which can provide detailed spatial information on organ abnormalities ready to be assessed by clinicians. In this paper, we propose the first fairness dataset for medical segmentation named Harvard-FairSeg with 10,000 subject samples. In addition, we propose a fair error-bound scaling approach to reweight the loss function with the upper error-bound in each identity group, using the segment anything model (SAM). We anticipate that the segmentation performance equity can be improved by explicitly tackling the hard cases with high training errors in each identity group. To facilitate fair comparisons, we utilize a novel equity-scaled segmentation performance metric to compare segmentation metrics in the context of fairness, such as the equity-scaled Dice coefficient. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our fair error-bound scaling approach either has superior or comparable fairness performance to the state-of-theart fairness learning models.

The approach involves the combination of four pharmacological agents, each targeting a distinct pathway involved in AD pathogenesis. Our data show that this combination therapy significantly improves cognitive function, reduces amyloid-\u03b2 plaques, and enhances synaptic plasticity. These findings suggest that this novel approach may be a promising treatment for AD. We also identify potential biomarkers for early detection of AD, which may aid in personalized treatment strategies.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nAlzheimer's disease (AD) is a complex neurodegenerative disorder characterized by cognitive decline, memory loss, and neuroinflammation. Current treatments for AD are limited, with many patients experiencing significant side effects. Therefore, the development of new therapeutic approaches is crucial. This study aims to investigate the efficacy of a multi-targeted combination therapy for treating AD.\n\n**Materials and Methods:**\n\nWe used a combination of four pharmacological agents: rivastigmine, memantine, donepezil, and galantamine. These agents were chosen based on their ability to target distinct pathways involved in AD pathogenesis, including cholinergic dysregulation, NMDA receptor antagonism, butyrylcholinesterase inhibition, and nicotinic acetylcholine receptor modulation.\n\n**Results:**\n\nOur data show that the combination therapy significantly improves cognitive function, as measured by the MMSE score. The combination therapy also reduces amyloid-\u03b2 plaques, as measured by PET imaging. Additionally, the combination therapy enhances synaptic plasticity, as measured by electrophysiological recordings.\n\n**Discussion:**\n\nOur findings suggest that this novel approach may be a promising treatment for AD. The combination of four pharmacological agents may offer a more efficacious treatment strategy than monotherapies, which are often limited by side effects. The reduction of amyloid-\u03b2 plaques may also aid in the early detection of AD, which may lead to personalized treatment strategies.\n\n**Future Directions:**\n\nFuture studies should investigate the long-term efficacy of this combination therapy, as well as its safety profile. Additionally, further research is needed to identify potential biomarkers for early detection of AD.\n\n**Conclusions:**\n\nIn conclusion, our study presents a novel therapeutic approach for treating AD through the development of a multi-targeted combination therapy. The combination therapy significantly improves cognitive function, reduces amyloid-\u03b2 plaques, and enhances synaptic plasticity. These findings suggest that this novel approach may be a promising treatment for AD.\n\n**Critique:**\n\nThe study presents an interesting approach to treating Alzheimer's disease, using a combination of four pharmacological agents. The authors' use of a multi-targeted strategy is a significant strength of the study.\n\nStrengths of the study include the use of a combination of agents targeting distinct pathways, which may offer a more efficacious treatment strategy than monotherapies. The study also highlights the potential for early detection of AD, which may aid in personalized treatment strategies.\n\nWeaknesses of the study include the small sample size, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the study lacks a control group, which may make it difficult to determine the efficacy of the combination therapy.\n\nTo strengthen the study, the authors could consider increasing the sample size to improve the generalizability of the findings. Additionally, the inclusion of a control group would provide a more robust comparison of the combination therapy to existing treatments.\n\n**Recommendation:**\n\nBased on the strengths and weaknesses of the study, I would recommend that the authors conduct further research to investigate the long-term efficacy of the combination therapy, as well as its safety profile. I would also recommend that the authors consider increasing the sample size to improve the generalizability of the findings.\n\n**Rating:**\n\nI would rate this study as 7 out of 10. The study presents an interesting approach to treating Alzheimer's disease, but it lacks a control group, which may limit the generalizability of the findings. With further research, this study has the potential to contribute significantly to the treatment of AD.\n\n**Author's Response:**\n\nWe appreciate the reviewer's critique of our study. We agree that the small sample size may limit the generalizability of the findings, and we plan to increase the sample size in future studies. We also appreciate the suggestion to include a control group, which we will consider for future studies.\n\nWe are pleased that the reviewer recognized the potential of our multi-targeted combination therapy for treating AD. We believe that our approach has the potential to offer a more efficacious treatment strategy than monotherapies, which are often limited by side effects.\n\nWe appreciate the reviewer's recommendation to conduct further research on the long-term efficacy of the combination therapy, as well as its safety profile. We agree that this is an important area of study, and we plan to conduct further research to address these concerns.\n\nOverall, we are grateful for the reviewer's feedback, which has provided us with valuable insights into the strengths and weaknesses of our study. We look forward to the opportunity to respond to any further comments from the reviewer.",

Inferred neural interactions from neural signals primarily reflect functional connectivity. In a long experiment, subject animals may experience different stages defined by the experiment, stimuli, or behavioral states, and hence functional connectivity can change over time. To model dynamically changing functional connectivity, prior work employs state-switching generalized linear models with hidden Markov models (i.e., HMM-GLMs). However, we argue they lack biological plausibility, as functional connectivities are shaped and confined by the underlying anatomical connectome. Here, we propose two novel priorinformed state-switching GLMs, called Gaussian HMM-GLM (Gaussian prior) and one-hot HMM-GLM (Gumbel-Softmax one-hot prior). We show that the learned prior should capture the state-invariant interaction, shedding light on the underlying anatomical connectome and revealing more likely physical neuron interactions. The state-dependent interaction modeled by each GLM offers traceability to capture functional variations across multiple brain states. Our methods effectively recover true interaction structures in simulated data, achieve the highest predictive likelihood, and enhance the interpretability of interaction patterns and hidden states when applied to real neural data.

This study proposes a novel approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases using microRNA-based gene editing. We used CRISPR-Cas9 system to introduce microRNAs (miRNAs) into neurons, which can modulate the expression of target genes involved in neurodegenerative diseases. Our results show that miRNA-based gene editing can effectively reduce the expression of disease-associated genes and improve neuronal function in vitro and in vivo models. These findings suggest that microRNA-based gene editing may be a promising therapeutic approach for treating neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Introduction:**\nThe introduction is clear and concise, providing an overview of the importance of developing novel therapeutic approaches for neurodegenerative diseases.

        "abstract": "This paper proposes a new framework of algorithms that is extended from the celebrated extragradient algorithm. The min-max problem has attracted increasing attention because of its applications in machine learning tasks such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) training. While there has been exhaustive research on convex-concave setting, problem of nonconvex-nonconcave setting faces many challenges, such as convergence to limit cycles. Given that general min-max optimization has been found to be intractable, recent research efforts have shifted towards tackling structured problems. One of these follows the weak Minty variational inequality (weak MVI), which is motivated by relaxing Minty variational inequality (MVI) without compromising convergence guarantee of extragradient algorithm. Existing extragradient-type algorithms involve one exploration step and one update step per iteration. We analyze the algorithms with multiple exploration steps and show that current assumption can be further relaxed when more exploration is introduced. Furthermore, we design an adaptive algorithm that explores until the optimal improvement is achieved. This process exploits information from the whole trajectory and effectively tackles cyclic behaviors.",

The authors analyze empirical data to assess how climate-related factors such as rising temperatures, changing precipitation patterns, and increased frequency of extreme weather events affect crop yields. The study concludes that climate-related stressors pose a significant threat to global food security.\n\n**Major Strengths:**\n1. **Comprehensive Literature Review**: The authors conduct a thorough analysis of existing research on climate change impacts on food security. The study synthesizes various empirical studies to provide a comprehensive overview of climate-related stressors on crop yields.\n2. **Clear Methodology**: The authors clearly outline their methodology for assessing climate-related stressors on crop yields. This includes analyzing temperature trends, precipitation patterns, and frequency of extreme weather events.\n3. **Data Analysis**: The authors effectively use empirical data to analyze climate-related stressors on crop yields. The use of spatial analysis tools allows for a comprehensive assessment of climate-related impacts on crop yields.\n\n**Major Weaknesses:**\n1. **Limited Geographic Scope**: The study focuses on global climate-related stressors on crop yields but does not consider regional-specific impacts. This limitation may not be representative of all regions.\n2. **Simplification of Climate-Related Stressors**: The authors oversimplify climate-related stressors by considering only temperature trends, precipitation patterns, and frequency of extreme weather events. This may not capture other climate-related stressors such as soil degradation or sea-level rise.\n3. **Insufficient Analysis of Adaptation Strategies**: The study does not adequately analyze adaptation strategies to mitigate climate-related impacts on food security. This may limit its ability to provide practical recommendations for policymakers.\n\n**Suggestions for Improvement:**\n1. **Expand Geographic Scope**: Consider analyzing climate-related stressors on crop yields at a regional level to increase its representativeness.\n2. **Incorporate Additional Climate-Related Stressors**: Include other climate-related stressors such as soil degradation or sea-level rise to provide a more comprehensive assessment of climate-related impacts on crop yields.\n3. **Conduct Sensitivity Analysis**: Perform sensitivity analysis to evaluate how different climate-related stressors impact crop yields.\n4. **Incorporate Adaptation Strategies**: Analyze adaptation strategies to mitigate climate-related impacts on food security.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nOverall, this study provides a comprehensive overview of climate-related stressors on global food security. However, its limitations in geographic scope, simplification of climate-related stressors, and insufficient analysis of adaptation strategies limit its ability to provide a nuanced understanding of climate-related impacts on food security. To strengthen its findings, I suggest that the authors expand their geographic scope, incorporate additional climate-related stressors, conduct sensitivity analysis, and analyze adaptation strategies.\n\n**Rating:** 7/10 (Recommend for Revision)\n\n**Recommendation:** I recommend that the authors revise their manuscript to address its limitations. I suggest that they expand their geographic scope, incorporate additional climate-related stressors, conduct sensitivity analysis, and analyze adaptation strategies.

Traditional filtering-based methods on motion analysis typically focus only on local and tiny motions, yet fail to represent large motions or 3D scenes. Recent dynamic neural representations can faithfully represent motions using correspondences, but they cannot be directly used for motion analysis. In this work, we propose Phase-based neural polynomial Gabor fields (Phase-PGF), which learns to represent scene dynamics with low-dimensional time-varying phases. We theoretically show that PhasePGF has several properties suitable for macro motion analysis. In our experiments, we collect diverse 2D and 3D dynamic scenes and show that Phase-PGF enables dynamic scene analysis and editing tasks including motion loop detection, motion factorization, motion smoothing, and motion magnification.

        "abstract": "The ever-growing complexity of reinforcement learning (RL) tasks demands a distributed system to efficiently generate and process a massive amount of data. However, existing open-source libraries suffer from various limitations, which impede their practical use in challenging scenarios where large-scale training is necessary. In this paper, we present a novel abstraction on the dataflows of RL training, which unifies diverse RL training applications into a general framework. Following this abstraction, we develop a scalable, efficient, and extensible distributed RL system called ReaLly Scalable RL (SRL), which allows efficient and massively parallelized training and easy development of customized algorithms. Our evaluation shows that SRL outperforms existing academic libraries, reaching at most 21x higher training throughput in a distributed setting.

The authors employ various statistical methods and environmental data to analyze the relationship between climate change and amphibian population dynamics.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. The authors demonstrate an extensive understanding of the complex interactions between climate change, habitat, and amphibian ecology. Their analysis of the environmental data and statistical models provides valuable insights into the effects of climate change on amphibian distribution and abundance.\n2. The authors provide clear and concise explanations of the methodology used in the study, making it accessible to readers without extensive background knowledge in ecology or statistics.\n3. The paper includes several relevant case studies from different tropical regions, which helps to illustrate the generalizability of the findings.\n\n**Weaknesses and Criticisms:**\n\n1. The study relies heavily on statistical models, which, although useful, do not fully capture the complexity of the interactions between climate change, habitat, and amphibian ecology. The authors could benefit from incorporating more qualitative and observational data to complement the statistical analysis.\n2. The paper does not explicitly address the potential biases and limitations of the study, such as sampling errors, data quality issues, and the potential for confounding factors. A more comprehensive discussion of these limitations would enhance the study's rigor and credibility.\n3. The authors could have explored alternative explanations for the observed patterns, such as changes in land-use practices, invasive species, or other anthropogenic factors that may be influencing amphibian population dynamics.\n4. The study could benefit from more detailed information on the taxonomic diversity of amphibians in the studied regions. The authors mention the presence of several species, but do not provide information on the relative abundance or distribution of each species.\n\n**Suggestions for Future Research:**\n\n1. Investigate the role of land-use practices and invasive species in shaping amphibian population dynamics in tropical regions.\n2. Conduct more detailed surveys of taxonomic diversity, including the relative abundance and distribution of each species.\n3. Develop more robust statistical models that incorporate both qualitative and quantitative data to better capture the complexity of the interactions between climate change, habitat, and amphibian ecology.\n4. Explore alternative explanations for the observed patterns, such as changes in water quality, soil moisture, or other environmental factors.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe paper by Dr. Maria Rodriguez, et al., provides valuable insights into the effects of climate change on amphibian distribution and abundance in tropical regions. While the study has several strengths, it also has limitations and potential biases. The authors could benefit from incorporating more qualitative and observational data, exploring alternative explanations, and developing more robust statistical models. Future research should aim to address these limitations and provide more comprehensive insights into the complex interactions between climate change, habitat, and amphibian ecology.\n\n**Rating:** 8/10\n\n**Recommendation:** This paper would be of great interest to researchers and practitioners working in the fields of ecology, conservation biology, and environmental science. However, to further strengthen the study, the authors should address the limitations and potential biases mentioned in this review and incorporate more comprehensive and robust methods to analyze the complex interactions between climate change, habitat, and amphibian ecology.",

        "abstract": "Training and deploying machine learning models that meet fairness criteria for protected groups are fundamental in modern artificial intelligence. While numerous constraints and regularization terms have been proposed in the literature to promote fairness in machine learning tasks, most of these approaches are not amenable to stochastic optimization due to the complex and nonlinear structure of constraints and regularizers. Here, the term \u201cstochastic\u201d refers to the ability of the algorithm to work with small mini-batches of data. Motivated by the limitation of existing literature, this paper presents a unified stochastic optimization framework for fair empirical risk minimization based on f -divergence measures (f -FERM). The proposed stochastic algorithm enjoys theoretical convergence guarantees. In addition, our experiments demonstrate the superiority of fairness-accuracy tradeoffs offered by f -FERM for almost all batch sizes (ranging from full-batch to batch size of one). Moreover, we show that our framework can be extended to the case where there is a distribution shift from training to the test data. Our extension is based on a distributionally robust optimization reformulation of f -FERM objective under lp norms as uncertainty sets. Again, in this distributionally robust setting, f -FERM not only enjoys theoretical convergence guarantees but also outperforms other baselines in the literature in the tasks involving distribution shifts. An efficient stochastic implementation of f -FERM is publicly available 1.",

Using a combination of econometric and statistical methods, we analyze data from 200 countries and find a statistically significant positive correlation between temperature increase and food insecurity. Our results also suggest that climate-related shocks to agriculture can have a disproportionate impact on vulnerable populations. We propose a framework for policymakers to address these challenges and mitigate climate-related food insecurity.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Overall Impression:**\nThe paper provides a thorough analysis of the relationship between climate change and food security, highlighting a critical issue affecting many countries worldwide. The authors employ a range of statistical methods to support their findings, demonstrating a strong understanding of empirical analysis.\n\n**Strengths:**\n\n1. **Comprehensive Data Set**: The paper utilizes a vast amount of data from 200 countries, which allows for a broad and representative analysis of climate-related food insecurity.\n2. **Statistical Methods**: The authors employ both econometric and statistical methods, providing a robust and comprehensive assessment of climate-related impacts on food security.\n3. **Clear Framework for Policymakers**: The paper proposes a practical framework for policymakers to address climate-related food insecurity, offering a valuable contribution to policy development.\n\n**Weaknesses:**\n\n1. **Methodological Limitations**: While the authors employ a range of statistical methods, some limitations in their approach may have influenced their findings. For example, they do not explicitly account for other factors influencing food security, such as income inequality or poverty levels.\n2. **Correlation vs. Causation**: The paper establishes a statistically significant positive correlation between temperature increase and food insecurity. However, this correlation does not necessarily imply causation. The authors should consider exploring potential mediators or confounding variables to strengthen their argument.\n3. **Regional Variability**: The paper's analysis is based on a broad, aggregated data set. Regional variability in climate, agriculture, and socio-economic factors may have influenced their findings. Future research could benefit from more detailed, region-by-region analyses.\n\n**Suggestions for Future Research:**\n\n1. **Account for Confounding Variables**: Explore potential mediators or confounding variables to strengthen their argument and provide a more nuanced understanding of climate-related food insecurity.\n2. **Regional Analysis**: Conduct more detailed, region-by-region analyses to account for variability in climate, agriculture, and socio-economic factors.\n3. **Longitudinal Analysis**: Incorporate longitudinal data to assess changes in climate-related food insecurity over time, providing insights into potential policy interventions.\n\n**Recommendation:**\nThe paper makes a valuable contribution to our understanding of climate-related food insecurity and provides a clear framework for policymakers to address these challenges. However, future research should aim to address some of the methodological limitations and limitations in their analysis. With further refinements, this study has the potential to inform effective policy interventions and mitigate climate-related food insecurity.\n\n**Rating:**\nThis paper is rated as \"Excellent\" due to its thorough analysis, clear framework for policymakers, and comprehensive data set. However, it is not without its limitations, and future research should strive to address these gaps to strengthen our understanding of climate-related food insecurity.",

        "abstract": "Contrastive learning has shown to be effective to learn representations from time series in a self-supervised way. However, contrasting similar time series instances or values from adjacent timestamps within a time series leads to ignore their inherent correlations, which results in deteriorating the quality of learned representations. To address this issue, we propose SoftCLT, a simple yet effective soft contrastive learning strategy for time series. This is achieved by introducing instance-wise and temporal contrastive loss with soft assignments ranging from zero to one. Specifically, we define soft assignments for 1) instance-wise contrastive loss by the distance between time series on the data space, and 2) temporal contrastive loss by the difference of timestamps. SoftCLT is a plug-and-play method for time series contrastive learning that improves the quality of learned representations without bells and whistles. In experiments, we demonstrate that SoftCLT consistently improves the performance in various downstream tasks including classification, semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, and anomaly detection, showing stateof-the-art performance.

        "abstract": "Estimating neural radiance fields (NeRFs) is able to generate novel views of a scene from known imagery. Recent approaches have afforded dramatic progress on small bounded regions of the scene. For an unbounded scene where cameras point in any direction and contents exist at any distance, certain mapping functions are used to represent it within a bounded space, yet they either work in object-centric scenes or focus on objects close to the camera. The goal of this paper is to understand how to design a proper mapping function that considers per-scene optimization, which remains unexplored. We first present a geometric understanding of existing mapping functions that express the relation between the bounded and unbounded scenes. Here, we exploit a stereographic projection method to explain failures of the mapping functions, where input ray samples are too sparse to account for scene geometry in unbounded regions. To overcome the failures, we propose a novel mapping function based on a p-norm distance, allowing to adaptively sample the rays by adjusting the p-value according to scene geometry, even in unbounded regions. To take the advantage of our mapping function, we also introduce a new ray parameterization to properly allocate ray samples in the geometry of unbounded regions. Through the incorporation of both the novel mapping function and the ray parameterization within existing NeRF frameworks, our method achieves state-ofthe-art novel view synthesis results on a variety of challenging datasets.",

The authors suggest that a specific cocktail of natural compounds, combined with a low-dose corticosteroid, can effectively mitigate the disease's inflammatory response. The proposed treatment involves administering the cocktail of natural compounds via a transdermal patch, allowing for a controlled release of the active ingredients.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n**Introduction:** \nThe introduction provides a clear overview of the importance of addressing Alzheimer's disease, particularly its inflammatory component. The authors highlight the need for innovative treatments that target this aspect of the disease. However, the literature review could benefit from a more comprehensive discussion of the current understanding of Alzheimer's disease pathophysiology.\n\n**Methods:** \nThe study's design appears to be a well-conceived, small-scale clinical trial. The inclusion of a low-dose corticosteroid in the treatment cocktail raises concerns about potential side effects and the risk of exacerbating the disease. It would be beneficial to include a control group receiving a standard corticosteroid regimen to provide a more accurate assessment of the treatment's efficacy.\n\n**Results:** \nThe results show a statistically significant reduction in inflammatory markers in the treatment group compared to the control group. However, the sample size was small, and the study lacked a long-term follow-up. It would be essential to include more patients and conduct a longer-term study to confirm these findings and explore potential side effects.\n\n**Discussion:** \nThe discussion highlights the potential benefits of the proposed treatment, but it also raises concerns about the need for further research. The authors acknowledge the limitations of their study but fail to address the potential long-term consequences of using corticosteroids in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease. A more critical evaluation of the treatment's potential side effects and the long-term effects on cognitive function would be necessary to fully understand its potential benefits.\n\n**Conclusion:** \nThe conclusion summarizes the main findings and emphasizes the potential of the proposed treatment. However, it also highlights the need for further research to fully validate the treatment's efficacy and safety. The authors should consider addressing the limitations of their study and providing a more comprehensive evaluation of the treatment's potential benefits and drawbacks.\n\n**Recommendation:** \nBased on the results of this review, I recommend that the authors consider the following revisions:\n\n1. Expand the sample size and conduct a longer-term follow-up study to confirm the treatment's efficacy and explore potential side effects.\n2. Include a control group receiving a standard corticosteroid regimen to provide a more accurate assessment of the treatment's efficacy.\n3. Conduct a more comprehensive evaluation of the treatment's potential side effects and the long-term effects on cognitive function.\n4. Provide a more detailed discussion of the potential long-term consequences of using corticosteroids in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nOverall, this paper presents an interesting approach to treating Alzheimer's disease, but it requires further refinement and rigorous testing to fully validate its potential benefits and safety.",

        "abstract": "Analyzing multivariate time series is important in many domains. However, it has been difficult to learn robust and generalizable representations within multivariate datasets due to complex inter-channel relationships and dynamic shifts. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for learning spatiotemporal structure and using it to improve the application of transformers to timeseries datasets. Our framework learns a set of group tokens, and builds an instance-specific group embedding (GE) layer that assigns input tokens to a small number of group tokens to incorporate structure into learning. We then introduce a novel architecture, GroupAware transFormer (GAFormer), which incorporates both spatial and temporal group embeddings to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a number of timeseries classification and regression tasks. In evaluations on a number of diverse timeseries datasets, we show that GE on its own can provide a nice enhancement to a number of backbones, and that by coupling spatial and temporal group embeddings, the GAFormer can outperform the existing baselines. Finally, we show how our approach discerns latent structures in data even without information about the spatial ordering of channels, and yields a more interpretable decomposition of spatial and temporal structure underlying complex multivariate datasets.",

The authors compare three different types of biodegradable polymers: Poly-L-Lactic Acid (PLLA), Poly-D-Lactic Acid (PDLA), and Poly-L-Asparatic Acid (PLAA). The authors evaluate their mechanical properties, degradation rates, and biocompatibility.

        "abstract": "Retrosynthetic planning is a sequential decision-making process of identifying synthetic routes from the available building block materials to reach a desired target molecule. Though existing planning approaches show promisingly high solving rates and route qualities, the trivial route quality evaluation via pre-trained forward reaction prediction models certainly falls short of real-world chemical practice. An alternative option is to annotate the actual quality of a route, such as yield, through chemical experiments or input from chemists, but this often leads to substantial query costs. In order to strike the balance between query costs and route quality evaluation, we propose an Active Retrosynthetic Planning (ARP) framework that remains compatible with the established retrosynthetic planners. On one hand, the proposed ARP trains an actor that decides whether to query the quality of a reaction; on the other hand, it resorts to a critic to estimate the value of a molecule with its preceding reaction quality as input. Those molecules with high reaction qualities are preferred to expand first. We apply our framework to different existing approaches on both the benchmark and an expert dataset and demonstrate that it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approach by 6.2% in route quality while reducing the query cost by 12.8%. In addition, ARP consistently plans high-quality routes with either abundant or sparse annotations.",

        "abstract": "Sample efficiency is a crucial problem in deep reinforcement learning. Recent algorithms, such as REDQ and DroQ, found a way to improve the sample efficiency by increasing the update-to-data (UTD) ratio to 20 gradient update steps on the critic per environment sample. However, this comes at the expense of a greatly increased computational cost. To reduce this computational burden, we introduce CrossQ: A lightweight algorithm for continuous control tasks that makes careful use of Batch Normalization and removes target networks to surpass the current state-of-the-art in sample efficiency while maintaining a low UTD ratio of 1. Notably, CrossQ does not rely on advanced bias-reduction schemes used in current methods. CrossQ\u2019s contributions are threefold: (1) it matches or surpasses current state-of-the-art methods in terms of sample efficiency, (2) it substantially reduces the computational cost compared to REDQ and DroQ, (3) it is easy to implement, requiring just a few lines of code on top of SAC.",

        "abstract": "Despite their impressive capabilities, large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating content that deviates from facts seen during pretraining. We propose a simple decoding strategy for reducing hallucinations with pretrained LLMs that does not require conditioning on retrieved external knowledge nor additional finetuning. Our approach obtains the next-token distribution by contrasting the differences in logits obtained from projecting the later layers versus earlier layers to the vocabulary space, exploiting the fact that factual knowledge in an LLMs has generally been shown to be localized to particular transformer layers. We find that this Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa) approach is able to better surface factual knowledge and reduce the generation of incorrect facts. DoLa consistently improves the truthfulness across multiple choices tasks and open-ended generation tasks, for example improving the performance of LLaMA family models on TruthfulQA by 12-17% absolute points, demonstrating its potential in making LLMs reliably generate truthful facts.1",

        "abstract": "Equipping agents with the capacity to justify made decisions using supporting evidence represents a cornerstone of accountable decision-making. Furthermore, ensuring that justifications are in line with human expectations and societal norms is vital, especially in high-stakes situations such as healthcare. In this work, we propose the use of a debate-based reward model for reinforcement learning agents, where the outcome of a zero-sum debate game quantifies the justifiability of a decision in a particular state. This reward model is then used to train a justifiable policy, whose decisions can be more easily corroborated with supporting evidence. In the debate game, two argumentative agents take turns providing supporting evidence for two competing decisions. Given the proposed evidence, a proxy of a human judge evaluates which decision is better justified. We demonstrate the potential of our approach in learning policies for prescribing and justifying treatment decisions of septic patients. We show that augmenting the reward with the feedback signal generated by the debate-based reward model yields policies highly favored by the judge when compared to the policy obtained solely from the environment rewards, while hardly sacrificing any performance. Moreover, in terms of the overall performance and justifiability of trained policies, the debate-based feedback is comparable to the feedback obtained from an ideal judge proxy that evaluates decisions using the full information encoded in the state. This suggests that the debate game outputs key information contained in states that is most relevant for evaluating decisions, which in turn substantiates the practicality of combining our approach with human-in-the-loop evaluations. Lastly, we showcase that agents trained via multi-agent debate learn to propose evidence that is resilient to refutations and closely aligns with human preferences.",

        "abstract": "Human visual recognition system shows astonishing capability of compressing visual information into a set of tokens containing rich representations without label supervision. One critical driving principle behind it is perceptual grouping (Palmer, 2002; Wagemans et al., 2012; Herzog, 2018). Despite being widely used in computer vision in the early 2010s, it remains a mystery whether perceptual grouping can be leveraged to derive a neural visual recognition backbone that generates as powerful representations. In this paper, we propose the Perceptual Group Tokenizer, a model that entirely relies on grouping operations to extract visual features and perform self-supervised representation learning, where a series of grouping operations are used to iteratively hypothesize the context for pixels or superpixels to refine feature representations. We show that the proposed model can achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art vision architectures, and inherits desirable properties including adaptive computation without re-training, and interpretability. Specifically, Perceptual Group Tokenizer achieves 80.3% on ImageNet-1K self-supervised learning benchmark with linear probe evaluation, establishing a new milestone for this paradigm.",

In this work, we study data-driven offline training for web agents with vision-language foundation models. We propose an instruction-following multimodal agent, WebGUM, that observes both webpage screenshots and HTML pages and outputs web navigation actions, such as click and type. WebGUM is trained by jointly finetuning an instruction-finetuned language model and a vision encoder with temporal and local perception on a large corpus of demonstrations. We empirically demonstrate this recipe improves the agent\u2019s ability of grounded multimodal perception, HTML comprehension, and multi-step reasoning, outperforming prior works by a significant margin. On the MiniWoB, we improve over the previous best offline methods by more than 45.8%, even outperforming online-finetuned SoTA, humans, and GPT-4-based agent. On the WebShop benchmark, our 3-billion-parameter model achieves superior performance to the existing SoTA, PaLM-540B. Furthermore, WebGUM exhibits strong positive transfer to the real-world planning tasks on the Mind2Web. We also collect 347K high-quality demonstrations using our trained models, 38 times larger than prior work, and make them available to promote future research in this direction.",

In this study, we introduce a novel approach using microRNA-based gene editing to treat neurodegenerative diseases. Our approach involves the use of CRISPR-Cas9 system to modify the expression of microRNAs that target disease-causing genes. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in treating Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis using in vitro and in vivo models. Our study provides new insights into the potential of microRNA-based gene editing as a therapeutic approach for neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nNeurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, have a significant impact on public health. Current treatments for these diseases have limited efficacy and often carry significant side effects. Therefore, there is a pressing need for the development of novel therapeutic strategies. MicroRNAs play a critical role in regulating gene expression, and alterations in microRNA expression have been implicated in the development of neurodegenerative diseases. Therefore, we propose a novel approach using microRNA-based gene editing to treat neurodegenerative diseases.\n\n**Methods:**\n\nWe employed the CRISPR-Cas9 system to modify the expression of microRNAs that target disease-causing genes. We designed a CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA to target the 3' untranslated region of the microRNA, which is responsible for its regulation. We then introduced the CRISPR-Cas9 system into neurons or cells expressing the disease-causing gene, and assessed the effect of microRNA expression on disease progression.\n\n**Results:**\n\nOur study demonstrated the efficacy of the microRNA-based gene editing approach in treating Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis using in vitro and in vivo models.

MicroRNAs play a critical role in regulating gene expression, and alterations in microRNA expression have been implicated in the development of neurodegenerative diseases.

We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach in treating Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, and highlight the potential of this approach for treating other neurodegenerative diseases. Future studies should focus on optimizing the delivery of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, and assessing the safety and efficacy of this approach in humans.\n\n**Critique:**\n\nThe study presents a novel approach using microRNA-based gene editing to treat neurodegenerative diseases. The use of the CRISPR-Cas9 system to modify microRNA expression is a promising approach, and the study demonstrates its efficacy in treating Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis.\n\nOne of the major strengths of the study is its use of in vitro and in vivo models to assess the efficacy of the microRNA-based gene editing approach. However, the study lacks a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effects of microRNA expression on disease progression. The authors could have benefited from a more in-depth analysis of the underlying molecular mechanisms.\n\nAnother area of concern is the lack of specificity in the targeting of microRNAs. The study uses a CRISPR-Cas9 guide RNA to target the 3' untranslated region of the microRNA, which may lead to off-target effects. The authors could have benefited from a more specific targeting approach, using techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9-based targeting of specific microRNA-binding proteins.\n\nAdditionally, the study lacks a comprehensive understanding of the delivery of the CRISPR-Cas9 system. The authors use a viral vector to deliver the CRISPR-Cas9 system, which may lead to immune responses and other side effects. The authors could have benefited from a more comprehensive understanding of the delivery of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, using techniques such as electroporation or lipofection.\n\nFinally, the study lacks a comprehensive understanding of the safety and efficacy of the microRNA-based gene editing approach in humans. The authors use in vitro and in vivo models to assess the efficacy of the approach, but the study lacks a comprehensive understanding of the effects of the approach on human cells.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\nBased on the critiques above, I recommend the following:\n\n1. The authors should conduct a more comprehensive analysis of the mechanisms underlying the effects of microRNA expression on disease progression.\n2. The authors should use a more specific targeting approach, using techniques such as CRISPR-Cas9-based targeting of specific microRNA-binding proteins.\n3. The authors should use a more comprehensive understanding of the delivery of the CRISPR-Cas9 system, using techniques such as electroporation or lipofection.\n4. The authors should conduct a comprehensive understanding of the safety and efficacy of the microRNA-based gene editing approach in humans.\n5. The authors should consider using a more robust and reproducible assay to assess the efficacy of the approach.\n\n**Rating:**\n\nBased on the critiques above, I would give this study a rating of 3.5 out of 5. The study presents a novel approach using microRNA-based gene editing to treat neurodegenerative diseases, and demonstrates its efficacy in treating Alzheimer's disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. However, the study lacks a comprehensive understanding of the mechanisms underlying the effects of microRNA expression on disease progression, and the delivery of the CRISPR-Cas9 system.",

        "abstract": "Numerous explainability methods have been proposed to shed light on the inner workings of GNNs. Despite the inclusion of empirical evaluations in all the proposed algorithms, the interrogative aspects of these evaluations lack diversity. As a result, various facets of explainability pertaining to GNNs, such as a comparative analysis of counterfactual reasoners, their stability to variational factors such as different GNN architectures, noise, stochasticity in non-convex loss surfaces, feasibility amidst domain constraints, and so forth, have yet to be formally investigated. Motivated by this need, we present a benchmarking study on perturbation-based explainability methods for GNNs, aiming to systematically evaluate and compare a wide range of explainability techniques. Among the key findings of our study, we identify the Pareto-optimal methods that exhibit superior efficacy and stability in the presence of noise. Nonetheless, our study reveals that all algorithms are affected by stability issues when faced with noisy data. Furthermore, we have established that the current generation of counterfactual explainers often fails to provide feasible recourses due to violations of topological constraints encoded by domain-specific considerations. Overall, this benchmarking study empowers stakeholders in the field of GNNs with a comprehensive understanding of the state-of-the-art explainability methods, potential research problems for further enhancement, and the implications of their application in real-world scenarios.",

        "abstract": "Seismic advances in generative AI algorithms for imagery, text, and other data types have led to the temptation to use AI-synthesized data to train next-generation models. Repeating this process creates an autophagous (\u201cself-consuming\u201d) loop whose properties are poorly understood. We conduct a thorough analytical and empirical analysis using state-of-the-art generative image models of three families of autophagous loops that differ in how fixed or fresh real training data is available through the generations of training and whether the samples from previous-generation models have been biased to trade off data quality versus diversity. Our primary conclusion across all scenarios is that without enough fresh real data in each generation of an autophagous loop, future generative models are doomed to have their quality (precision) or diversity (recall) progressively decrease. We term this condition Model Autophagy Disorder (MAD), by analogy to mad cow disease, and show that appreciable MADness arises in just a few generations. Generation t = 1 t = 3 t = 5 t = 7 t = 9 Figure 1: Training generative artificial intelligence (AI) models on synthetic data progressively amplifies artifacts. As AI-synthesized data proliferates in standard datasets and the Internet, future AI models will train on both real and synthetic data, forming autophagous (\u201cself-consuming\u201d) loops. Here we highlight a potential unintended consequence of autophagous training. We trained a sequence of StyleGAN2 (Karras et al., 2019a) models wherein the model at generation t \u2265 2 trains only on data synthesized by the model at generation t\u2212 1. This setup is a fully synthetic loop (Figure 3) without sampling bias (\u03bb = 1). Note how the cross-hatched artifacts (possibly an architectural fingerprint (Karras et al., 2021)) are progressively amplified at each generation. Appendix D has more samples.",

The author reviews existing literature to examine the relationship between climate change, agricultural productivity, and food availability. The study finds that climate change is likely to lead to reduced crop yields, changes in growing seasons, and altered distribution patterns, which can compromise global food security. The author suggests that mitigation strategies, such as climate-resilient agriculture and sustainable water management, can help to minimize the impacts of climate change on food security.\n\n**Peer Review:**\n\n**Introduction:**\n\nThe paper begins by setting the stage for the discussion, stating that climate change is a pressing global issue that affects not only the environment but also human societies. The author provides a clear overview of the topic, but it would be beneficial to include a more concise definition of climate change and its impact on food security. The literature review that follows is comprehensive, but the author could have provided more context and explanations to help readers understand the relevance and significance of the review.\n\n**Methodology:**\n\nThe author provides a thorough review of existing literature, which is a significant contribution to the field. However, the inclusion criteria and search strategy are not explicitly stated, which may raise concerns about the comprehensiveness and validity of the review. The author could have also considered other sources, such as grey literature, policy documents, and primary research studies, to provide a more comprehensive overview. Furthermore, the author's interpretation and synthesis of the existing literature could be improved by providing more critical analysis and discussion.\n\n**Results:**\n\nThe results section is concise and effectively summarizes the main findings, but it would be beneficial to include more visual aids, such as figures and tables, to help illustrate the complex relationships between climate change, agricultural productivity, and food availability. The author's use of data visualization is good, but the data sources are not explicitly stated, which may raise questions about the reliability and accuracy of the data.\n\n**Discussion:**\n\nThe discussion section provides a clear overview of the implications of climate change on global food security, but it would be beneficial to provide more concrete examples and case studies to illustrate the potential impacts. The author's suggestions for mitigation strategies, such as climate-resilient agriculture and sustainable water management, are timely and relevant, but they could be supported by more empirical evidence and analysis. The author could also have explored the potential trade-offs and challenges associated with implementing these strategies, which would provide a more nuanced understanding of the topic.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe conclusion summarizes the main findings and reiterates the importance of addressing climate change to ensure global food security. However, the author could have provided more context and explanations to help readers understand the relevance and significance of the review. The paper concludes with a call to action, but the author could have provided more specific recommendations and policy suggestions to help readers understand how to address the issue.\n\n**Recommendations:**\n\nBased on the review, I would like to make the following recommendations to the author:\n\n1. Provide more explicit definitions and explanations to help readers understand the topic and its significance.\n2. Consider other sources and include a more comprehensive search strategy to ensure the validity and comprehensiveness of the review.\n3. Use more critical analysis and discussion to synthesize the existing literature and provide a more nuanced understanding of the topic.\n4. Include more visual aids, such as figures and tables, to help illustrate complex relationships and data.\n5. Provide more concrete examples and case studies to illustrate the potential impacts and implications.\n6. Support mitigation strategies with empirical evidence and analysis to provide a more convincing case.\n7.

        "title": "BEYOND MEMORIZATION: VIOLATING PRIVACY VIA INFERENCE WITH LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS",
        "abstract": "Current privacy research on large language models (LLMs) primarily focuses on the issue of extracting memorized training data. At the same time, models\u2019 inference capabilities have increased drastically. This raises the key question of whether current LLMs could violate individuals\u2019 privacy by inferring personal attributes from text given at inference time. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study on the capabilities of pretrained LLMs to infer personal attributes from text. We construct a dataset consisting of real Reddit profiles, and show that current LLMs can infer a wide range of personal attributes (e.g., location, income, sex), achieving up to 85% top-1 and 95% top-3 accuracy at a fraction of the cost (100\u00d7) and time (240\u00d7) required by humans. As people increasingly interact with LLM-powered chatbots across all aspects of life, we also explore the emerging threat of privacy-invasive chatbots trying to extract personal information through seemingly benign questions. Finally, we show that common mitigations, i.e., text anonymization and model alignment, are currently ineffective at protecting user privacy against LLM inference. Our findings highlight that current LLMs can infer personal data at a previously unattainable scale. In the absence of working defenses, we advocate for a broader discussion around LLM privacy implications beyond memorization, striving for a wider privacy protection.",

Despite its promise, existing entity segmentation methods like Segment Anything Model (SAM) rely heavily on costly expert annotators. This work presents Self-supervised Open-world Hierarchical Entity Segmentation (SOHES), a novel approach that sidesteps the need for human annotations. SOHES operates in three phases: self-exploration, self-instruction, and self-correction. Given a pretrained self-supervised representation, we produce abundant high-quality pseudolabels through visual feature clustering. Then, we train a segmentation model on the pseudo-labels, and rectify the noises in pseudo-labels via a teacher-student mutual-learning procedure. Beyond segmenting entities, SOHES also captures their constituent parts, providing a hierarchical understanding of visual entities. Using raw images as the sole training data, our method achieves unprecedented performance in self-supervised open-world segmentation, marking a significant milestone towards high-quality open-world entity segmentation in the absence of human-annotated masks.",

        "abstract": "Protein design, a grand challenge of the day, involves optimization on a fitness landscape, and leading methods adopt a model-based approach where a model is trained on a training set (protein sequences and fitness) and proposes candidates to explore next. These methods are challenged by sparsity of high-fitness samples in the training set, a problem that has been in the literature. A less recognized but equally important problem stems from the distribution of training samples in the design space: leading methods are not designed for scenarios where the desired optimum is in a region that is not only poorly represented in training data, but also relatively far from the highly represented low-fitness regions. We show that this problem of \u201cseparation\u201d in the design space is a significant bottleneck in existing model-based optimization tools and propose a new approach that uses a novel VAE as its search model to overcome the problem. We demonstrate its advantage over prior methods in robustly finding improved samples, regardless of the imbalance and separation between lowand high-fitness training samples. Our comprehensive benchmark on real and semi-synthetic protein datasets as well as solution design for physics-informed neural networks, showcases the generality of our approach in discrete and continuous design spaces. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/sabagh1994/PGVAE.",
