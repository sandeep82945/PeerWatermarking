        "abstract": "Centre for Medical Image Computing, UCL, London, United Kingdom Microsoft Research, Cambridge ABSTRACT Scientific discovery hinges on the effective integration of metadata, which refers to a set of conceptual operations such as determining what information is relevant for inquiry, and data, which encompasses physical operations such as observation and experimentation. This paper introduces the Causal Modelling Agent (CMA), a novel framework that synergizes the metadata-based reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) with the data-driven modelling of Deep Structural Causal Models (DSCMs) for the task of causal discovery. We evaluate the CMA\u2019s performance on a number of benchmarks, as well as on the real-world task of modelling the clinical and radiological phenotype of Alzheimer\u2019s Disease (AD). Our experimental results indicate that the CMA can outperform previous purely data-driven or metadata-driven approaches to causal discovery. In our real-world application, we use the CMA to derive new insights into the causal relationships among biomarkers of AD.",

        "abstract": "Our understanding of the visual world is centered around various concept axes, characterizing different aspects of visual entities. While different concept axes can be easily specified by language, e.g., color, the exact visual nuances along each axis often exceed the limitations of linguistic articulations, e.g., a particular style of painting. In this work, our goal is to learn a language-informed visual concept representation, by simply distilling large pre-trained vision-language models. Specifically, we train a set of concept encoders to encode the information pertinent to a set of language-informed concept axes, with an objective of reproducing the input image through a pre-trained Text-to-Image (T2I) model. To encourage better disentanglement of different concept encoders, we anchor the concept embeddings to a set of text embeddings obtained from a pre-trained Visual Question Answering (VQA) model. At inference time, the model extracts concept embeddings along various axes from new test images, which can be remixed to generate images with novel compositions of visual concepts. With a lightweight test-time finetuning procedure, it can also generalize to novel concepts unseen at training. Project page at https://cs.stanford.edu/ \u0303yzzhang/projects/concept-axes.",

We consider motion as an important cue for identifying parts, that all particles on the same part share the common motion pattern. From the perspective of fluid simulation, existing deformation-based methods for dynamic NeRF can be seen as parameterizing the scene motion under the Eulerian view, i.e., focusing on specific locations in space through which the fluid flows as time passes. However, it is intractable to extract the motion of constituting objects or parts using the Eulerian view representation. In this work, we introduce the dual Lagrangian view and enforce representations under the Eulerian/Lagrangian views to be cycle-consistent. Under the Lagrangian view, we parameterize the scene motion by tracking the trajectory of particles on objects. The Lagrangian view makes it convenient to discover parts by factorizing the scene motion as a composition of part-level rigid motions. Experimentally, our method can achieve fast and high-quality dynamic scene reconstruction from even a single moving camera, and the induced part-based representation allows direct applications of part tracking, animation, 3D scene editing, etc.",

        "abstract": "Offline reinforcement learning (RL), which aims to fully explore offline datasets for training without interaction with environments, has attracted growing recent attention. A major challenge for the real-world application of offline RL stems from the robustness against state observation perturbations, e.g., as a result of sensor errors or adversarial attacks. Unlike online robust RL, agents cannot be adversarially trained in the offline setting. In this work, we propose Diffusion Model-Based Predictor (DMBP) in a new framework that recovers the actual states with conditional diffusion models for state-based RL tasks. To mitigate the error accumulation issue in model-based estimation resulting from the classical training of conventional diffusion models, we propose a non-Markovian training objective to minimize the sum entropy of denoised states in RL trajectory. Experiments on standard benchmark problems demonstrate that DMBP can significantly enhance the robustness of existing offline RL algorithms against different scales of random noises and adversarial attacks on state observations. Further, the proposed framework can effectively deal with incomplete state observations with random combinations of multiple unobserved dimensions in the test.

Though existing approaches in protein design have thoroughly explored structure-to-sequence dependencies in proteins, RNA design still confronts difficulties due to structural complexity and data scarcity. Moreover, direct transplantation of protein design methodologies into RNA design fails to achieve satisfactory outcomes although sharing similar structural components. In this study, we aim to systematically construct a data-driven RNA design pipeline. We crafted a large, well-curated benchmark dataset and designed a comprehensive structural modeling approach to represent the complex RNA tertiary structure. More importantly, we proposed a hierarchical data-efficient representation learning framework that learns structural representations through contrastive learning at both clusterlevel and sample-level to fully leverage the limited data. By constraining data representations within a limited hyperspherical space, the intrinsic relationships between data points could be explicitly imposed. Moreover, we incorporated extracted secondary structures with base pairs as prior knowledge to facilitate the RNA design process. Extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our proposed method, providing a reliable baseline for future RNA design tasks.

The \u201cswap\u201d of the commonly used linear regression with the EWR in optimization is analytically demonstrated to offer noise mitigation effects by incorporating neighborhood interpolation across data points with only marginal additional computational cost. The unique strength of SWAP is its intrinsic ability to balance noise reduction and covariance information preservation effectively.

Our proposed method outperforms the SoTA when the network size or the target sparsity is large, the gain is even larger with the existence of noisy gradients, possibly from noisy data, analog memory, or adversarial attacks.

        "abstract": "Visual reinforcement learning (RL) has shown promise in continuous control tasks. Despite its progress, current algorithms are still unsatisfactory in virtually every aspect of the performance such as sample efficiency, asymptotic performance, and their robustness to the choice of random seeds. In this paper, we identify a major shortcoming in existing visual RL methods that is the agents often exhibit sustained inactivity during early training, thereby limiting their ability to explore effectively. Expanding upon this crucial observation, we additionally unveil a significant correlation between the agents\u2019 inclination towards motorically inactive exploration and the absence of neuronal activity within their policy networks. To quantify this inactivity, we adopt dormant ratio (Sokar et al., 2023) as a metric to measure inactivity in the RL agent\u2019s network. Empirically, we also recognize that the dormant ratio can act as a standalone indicator of an agent\u2019s activity level, regardless of the received reward signals. Leveraging the aforementioned insights, we introduce DrM , a method that uses three core mechanisms to guide agents\u2019 exploration-exploitation trade-offs by actively minimizing the dormant ratio. Experiments demonstrate that DrM achieves significant improvements in sample efficiency and asymptotic performance with no broken seeds (76 seeds in total) across three continuous control benchmark environments, including DeepMind Control Suite, MetaWorld, and Adroit. Most importantly, DrM is the first model-free algorithm that consistently solves tasks in both the Dog and Manipulator domains from the DeepMind Control Suite as well as three dexterous hand manipulation tasks without demonstrations in Adroit, all based on pixel observations. 1 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Training Progress 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 Ep iso de R ew ar d Deepmind Control Suite (8 Hard Tasks) 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Training Progress 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Su cc es s R at e MetaWorld (8 Tasks) 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Training Progress 0% 20% 40% 60% 80% 100% Su cc es s R at e Adroit (3 Tasks) DrM DrQ-v2 ALIX TACO Figure 1: Success rate and episode reward as a function of training progress for each of the three domains that we consider (Deepmind Control Suite, MetaWorld, Adroit).

        "abstract": "Learning neural subset selection tasks, such as compound selection in AI-aided drug discovery, have become increasingly pivotal across diverse applications. The existing methodologies in the field primarily concentrate on constructing models that capture the relationship between utility function values and subsets within their respective supersets. However, these approaches tend to overlook the valuable information contained within the superset when utilizing neural networks to model set functions. In this work, we address this oversight by adopting a probabilistic perspective. Our theoretical findings demonstrate that when the target value is conditioned on both the input set and subset, it is essential to incorporate an invariant sufficient statistic of the superset into the subset of interest for effective learning. This ensures that the output value remains invariant to permutations of the subset and its corresponding superset, enabling identification of the specific superset from which the subset originated. Motivated by these insights, we propose a simple yet effective information aggregation module designed to merge the representations of subsets and supersets from a permutation invariance perspective. Comprehensive empirical evaluations across diverse tasks and datasets validate the enhanced efficacy of our approach over conventional methods, underscoring the practicality and potency of our proposed strategies in real-world contexts.",

        "abstract": "Spiking Neural Networks (SNNs) are attracting growing interest for their energyefficient computing when implemented on neuromorphic hardware. However, directly training SNNs, even adopting batch normalization (BN), is highly challenging due to their non-differentiable activation function and the temporally delayed accumulation of outputs over time. For SNN training, this temporal accumulation gives rise to Temporal Covariate Shifts (TCS) along the temporal dimension, a phenomenon that would become increasingly pronounced with layer-wise computations across multiple layers and multiple time-steps. In this paper, we introduce TAB (Temporal Accumulated Batch Normalization), a novel SNN batch normalization method that addresses the temporal covariate shift issue by aligning with neuron dynamics (specifically the accumulated membrane potential) and utilizing temporal accumulated statistics for data normalization. Within its framework, TAB effectively encapsulates the historical temporal dependencies that underlie the membrane potential accumulation process, thereby establishing a natural connection between neuron dynamics and TAB batch normalization. Experimental results on CIFAR-10, CIFAR-100, and DVS-CIFAR10 show that our TAB method outperforms other state-of-the-art methods.",

        "title": "A UNIFIED SAMPLING FRAMEWORK FOR SOLVER SEARCHING OF DIFFUSION PROBABILISTIC MODELS",
        "abstract": "Recent years have witnessed the rapid progress and broad application of diffusion probabilistic models (DPMs). Sampling from DPMs can be viewed as solving an ordinary differential equation (ODE). Despite the promising performance, the generation of DPMs usually consumes much time due to the large number of function evaluations (NFE). Though recent works have accelerated the sampling to around 20 steps with high-order solvers, the sample quality with less than 10 NFE can still be improved. In this paper, we propose a unified sampling framework (USF) to study the optional strategies for solver. Under this framework, we further reveal that taking different solving strategies at different timesteps may help further decrease the truncation error, and a carefully designed solver schedule has the potential to improve the sample quality by a large margin. Therefore, we propose a new sampling framework based on the exponential integral formulation that allows free choices of solver strategy at each step and design specific decisions for the framework. Moreover, we propose S, a predictor-based search method that automatically optimizes the solver schedule to get a better time-quality trade-off of sampling. We demonstrate that S can find outstanding solver schedules which outperform the state-of-the-art sampling methods on CIFAR-10, CelebA, ImageNet, and LSUN-Bedroom datasets. Specifically, we achieve 2.69 FID with 10 NFE and 6.86 FID with 5 NFE on CIFAR-10 dataset, outperforming the SOTA method significantly. We further apply S to Stable-Diffusion model and get an acceleration ratio of 2\u00d7, showing the feasibility of sampling in very few steps without retraining the neural network.",

To bridge this gap, we propose a novel generative pre-training framework, GPD, for spatio-temporal few-shot learning with urban knowledge transfer. Unlike conventional approaches that heavily rely on common feature extraction or intricate few-shot learning designs, our solution takes a novel approach by performing generative pre-training on a collection of neural network parameters optimized with data from source cities. We recast spatio-temporal few-shot learning as pre-training a generative diffusion model, which generates tailored neural networks guided by prompts, allowing for adaptability to diverse data distributions and city-specific characteristics. GPD employs a Transformer-based denoising diffusion model, which is model-agnostic to integrate with powerful spatio-temporal neural networks. By addressing challenges arising from data gaps and the complexity of generalizing knowledge across cities, our framework consistently outperforms state-of-the-art baselines on multiple real-world datasets for tasks such as traffic speed prediction and crowd flow prediction.

Typically, these environments remain unchanged unless agents interact with them. However, in real-world scenarios, agents might also face dynamically changing environments characterized by unexpected events and need to rapidly take action accordingly. To remedy this gap, we propose a new simulated embodied benchmark, called HAZARD, specifically designed to assess the decision-making abilities of embodied agents in dynamic situations. HAZARD consists of three unexpected disaster scenarios, including fire , flood , and wind , and specifically supports the utilization of large language models (LLMs) to assist common sense reasoning and decision-making. This benchmark enables us to evaluate autonomous agents\u2019 decision-making capabilities across various pipelines, including reinforcement learning (RL), rule-based, and search-based methods in dynamically changing environments.

The approach, called retro-fallback, is designed to maximize the successful synthesis probability (SSP) of a synthesis plan in uncertain chemical reaction networks. SSP is a metric that quantifies the probability that at least one synthesis plan found by an algorithm will work in the lab. The authors argue that existing retrosynthesis algorithms have several limitations, including imperfect knowledge of the space of possible reactions and the inability to account for uncertainty in reaction outcomes. They propose a new formulation of retrosynthesis in terms of stochastic processes to account for uncertainty and present a novel greedy algorithm called retro-fallback that maximizes SSP. The authors evaluate retro-fallback experimentally and demonstrate that it outperforms existing algorithms in terms of SSP. The authors also discuss potential future work, including the development of more advanced feasibility models and the exploration of learning heuristics for retro-fallback using machine learning techniques.\n\nThe authors' approach is a significant contribution to the field of retrosynthesis, as it addresses several of the limitations of existing algorithms. The proposed formulation of retrosynthesis in terms of stochastic processes is a novel approach that allows for the quantification of uncertainty in reaction outcomes. The retro-fallback algorithm is a practical implementation of this approach, and its evaluation on a range of experimental benchmarks is a strong indication of its efficacy. The authors' discussion of potential future work is also an important contribution, as it highlights the need for further research in this area and provides a clear direction for future investigation.\n\nOne of the strengths of the authors' approach is its ability to account for uncertainty in reaction outcomes. The use of stochastic processes to model uncertainty in reaction outcomes is a novel approach that allows for the quantification of uncertainty in a way that is not possible with existing algorithms. The authors' evaluation of retro-fallback on a range of experimental benchmarks is also a strong indication of its efficacy, as it shows that the algorithm can effectively maximize SSP in uncertain chemical reaction networks.\n\nHowever, there are also some limitations to the authors' approach. One of the main limitations is the complexity of the stochastic processes that are used to model uncertainty in reaction outcomes. The authors propose a range of different feasibility models, including models that assume independence between reaction outcomes and models that assume non-independence. However, the evaluation of retro-fallback on these different models is limited, and it is not clear how well the algorithm will perform in practice. Additionally, the authors' discussion of potential future work is limited, and it is not clear how the development of more advanced feasibility models or the exploration of learning heuristics for retro-fallback will impact the overall performance of the algorithm.\n\nIn terms of the overall impact of the authors' work, it is clear that retro-fallback is a significant contribution to the field of retrosynthesis.

This popularity stems partly from their impressive performance and partly from their ability to provide meaningful feature representations in the latent space. Wasserstein Autoencoders (WAEs), a variant of VAEs, aim to not only improve model efficiency but also interpretability. However, there has been limited focus on analyzing their statistical guarantees. The matter is further complicated by the fact that the data distributions to which WAEs are applied such as natural images are often presumed to possess an underlying low-dimensional structure within a high-dimensional feature space, which current theory does not adequately account for, rendering known bounds inefficient. To bridge the gap between the theory and practice of WAEs, in this paper, we show that WAEs can learn the data distributions when the network architectures are properly chosen.

        "abstract": "Reward modeling (a.k.a., preference modeling) is instrumental for aligning large language models with human preferences, particularly within the context of reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). While conventional reward models (RMs) have exhibited remarkable scalability, they oft struggle with fundamental functionality such as arithmetic computation, code execution, and factual lookup. In this paper, we propose a tool-augmented preference modeling approach, named Themis, to address these limitations by empowering RMs with access to external environments, including calculators and search engines. This approach not only fosters synergy between tool utilization and reward grading but also enhances interpretive capacity and scoring reliability. Our study delves into the integration of external tools into RMs, enabling them to interact with diverse external sources and construct task-specific tool engagement and reasoning traces in an autoregressive manner. We validate our approach across a wide range of domains, incorporating seven distinct external tools. Our experimental results demonstrate a noteworthy overall improvement of 17.7% across eight tasks in preference ranking. Furthermore, our approach outperforms Gopher 280B by 7.3% on TruthfulQA task in zero-shot evaluation. In human evaluations, RLHF trained with Themis attains an average win rate of 32% when compared to baselines across four distinct tasks. Additionally, we provide a comprehensive collection of tool-related RM datasets, incorporating data from seven distinct tool APIs, totaling 15,000 instances.

        "abstract": "As large language models (LLMs) are adopted as a fundamental component of language technologies, it is crucial to accurately characterize their performance. Because choices in prompt design can strongly influence model behavior, this design process is critical in effectively using any modern pre-trained generative language model. In this work, we focus on LLM sensitivity to a quintessential class of meaning-preserving design choices: prompt formatting. We find that several widely used open-source LLMs are extremely sensitive to subtle changes in prompt formatting in few-shot settings, with performance differences of up to 76 accuracy points when evaluated using LLaMA-2-13B. Sensitivity remains even when increasing model size, the number of few-shot examples, or performing instruction tuning. Our analysis suggests that work evaluating LLMs with prompting-based methods would benefit from reporting a range of performance across plausible prompt formats, instead of the currently-standard practice of reporting performance on a single format. We also show that format performance only weakly correlates between models, which puts into question the methodological validity of comparing models with an arbitrarily chosen, fixed prompt format. To facilitate systematic analysis we propose FORMATSPREAD, an algorithm that rapidly evaluates a sampled set of plausible prompt formats for a given task, and reports the interval of expected performance without accessing model weights1. Furthermore, we present a suite of analyses that characterize the nature of this sensitivity, including exploring the influence of particular atomic perturbations and the internal representation of particular formats.",

Learning world models from reward-free exploration is a promising approach, and enables policies to be trained using imagined experience for new tasks. However, achieving a general agent requires robustness across different environments. In this work, we address the novel problem of generating curricula in the reward-free setting to train robust world models. We consider robustness in terms of minimax regret over all environment instantiations and show that the minimax regret can be connected to minimising the maximum error in the world model across environment instances. This result informs our algorithm, WAKER: Weighted Acquisition of Knowledge across Environments for Robustness. WAKER selects environments for data collection based on the estimated error of the world model for each environment.

        "abstract": "In-context learning is a promising paradigm that utilizes in-context examples as prompts for the predictions of large language models. These prompts are crucial for achieving strong performance. However, since the prompts need to be sampled from a large volume of annotated examples, finding the right prompt may result in high annotation costs. To address this challenge, this paper introduces an influence-driven selective annotation method that aims to minimize annotation costs while improving the quality of in-context examples. The essence of our method is to select a pivotal subset from a large-scale unlabeled data pool to annotate for the subsequent sampling of prompts. Specifically, a directed graph is first constructed to represent unlabeled data. Afterward, the influence of candidate unlabeled subsets is quantified with a diffusion process. A simple yet effective greedy algorithm for unlabeled data selection is lastly introduced. It iteratively selects the data if it provides a maximum marginal gain with respect to quantified influence. Compared with previous efforts on selective annotations, our influencedriven method works in an end-to-end manner, avoids an intractable explicit balance between data diversity and representativeness, and enjoys theoretical support. Experiments confirm the superiority of the proposed method on various benchmarks, achieving better performance under lower time consumption during subset selection.

        "title": "WIN-WIN: TRAINING HIGH-RESOLUTION VISION TRANSFORMERS",
        "abstract": "Transformers have become the standard in state-of-the-art vision architectures, achieving impressive performance on both image-level and dense pixelwise tasks. However, training vision transformers for high-resolution pixelwise tasks has a prohibitive cost. Typical solutions boil down to hierarchical architectures, fast and approximate attention, or training on low-resolution crops. This latter solution does not constrain architectural choices, but it leads to a clear performance drop when testing at resolutions significantly higher than that used for training, thus requiring ad-hoc and slow post-processing schemes. In this paper, we propose a novel strategy for efficient training and inference of high-resolution vision transformers: the key principle is to mask out most of the high-resolution inputs during training, keeping only N random windows. This allows the model to learn local interactions between tokens inside each window, and global interactions between tokens from different windows. As a result, the model can directly process the high-resolution input at test time without any special trick. We show that this strategy is effective when using relative positional embedding such as rotary embeddings. It is 4 times faster to train than a full-resolution network, and it is straightforward to use at test time compared to existing approaches. We apply this strategy to two dense prediction tasks with high resolution data. First, we show on the task of semantic segmentation that a simple setting with 2 windows performs best, hence the name of our method: Win-Win. To demonstrate the generality of our contribution, we further extend it to the binocular task of optical flow, reaching state-of-the-art performance on the Spring benchmark that contains Full-HD images with an inference time an order of magnitude faster than the best competitor. 0 10 20 30 40 50 60 Training time (hours) 45 50 55 60 m ea n Io U Semantic segmentation on BDD100k Win-Win (31GB) Full-res.

        "title": "THRESHOLD-CONSISTENT MARGIN LOSS FOR OPEN- WORLD DEEP METRIC LEARNING",
        "abstract": "Existing losses used in deep metric learning (DML) for image retrieval often lead to highly non-uniform intra-class and inter-class representation structures across test classes and data distributions. When combined with the common practice of using a fixed threshold to declare a match, this gives rise to significant performance variations in terms of false accept rate (FAR) and false reject rate (FRR) across test classes and data distributions. We define this issue in DML as threshold inconsistency. In real-world applications, such inconsistency often complicates the threshold selection process when deploying commercial image retrieval systems. To measure this inconsistency, we propose a novel variance-based metric called Operating-Point-Inconsistency-Score (OPIS) that quantifies the variance in the operating characteristics across classes. Using the OPIS metric, we find that achieving high accuracy levels in a DML model does not automatically guarantee threshold consistency. In fact, our investigation reveals a Pareto frontier in the high-accuracy regime, where existing methods to improve accuracy often lead to degradation in threshold consistency. To address this trade-off, we introduce the Threshold-Consistent Margin (TCM) loss, a simple yet effective regularization technique that promotes uniformity in representation structures across classes by selectively penalizing hard sample pairs. Extensive experiments demonstrate TCM\u2019s effectiveness in enhancing threshold consistency while preserving accuracy, simplifying the threshold selection process in practical DML settings.",

The TCM loss can fail when there\u2019s a significant distribution shift between the training and test sets or when strong label noise is present.\n3. The experiments are conducted on a limited number of image retrieval benchmarks, and it is not clear if the results can be generalized to other datasets or scenarios.\n\nSuggestions for improvement:\n1. The OPIS metric can be improved by incorporating additional metrics or features to make it more robust to different scenarios.\n2. The TCM loss can be improved by incorporating additional regularization terms or techniques to make it more robust to distribution shifts and label noise.\n3. The experiments can be conducted on a broader range of image retrieval benchmarks and scenarios to demonstrate the generalizability of the proposed TCM loss.\n\nRecommendation:\nThe proposed OPIS metric and TCM loss are novel and effective in improving threshold consistency in DML models. However, further improvements and generalization to other datasets and scenarios are needed to make the results more robust and applicable to practical open-world scenarios.\n\n$$$$",

        "abstract": "COMpression with Bayesian Implicit NEural Representations (COMBINER) is a recent data compression method that addresses a key inefficiency of previous Implicit Neural Representation (INR)-based approaches: it avoids quantization and enables direct optimization of the rate-distortion performance.

Our proposed method, Robust and Enhanced COMBINER (RECOMBINER), addresses these issues by 1) enriching the variational approximation while retaining a low computational cost via a linear reparameterization of the INR weights, 2) augmenting our INRs with learnable positional encodings that enable them to adapt to local details and 3) splitting high-resolution data into patches to increase robustness and utilizing expressive hierarchical priors to capture dependency across patches. We conduct extensive experiments across several data modalities, showcasing that RECOMBINER achieves competitive results with the best INR-based methods and even outperforms autoencoder-based codecs on lowresolution images at low bitrates.

Existing methods for generative modeling on manifolds either require expensive simulation, are inherently unable to scale to high dimensions, or use approximations for limiting quantities that result in biased training objectives. Riemannian Flow Matching bypasses these limitations and offers several advantages over previous approaches: it is simulation-free on simple geometries, does not require divergence computation, and computes its target vector field in closed-form. The key ingredient behind RFM is the construction of a relatively simple premetric for defining target vector fields, which encompasses the existing Euclidean case. To extend to general geometries, we rely on the use of spectral decompositions to efficiently compute premetrics on the fly.

However, the memory demands imposed by Transformers limit their ability to handle long sequences, thereby posing challenges in utilizing videos, actions, and other long-form sequences and modalities in complex environments. We present a novel approach, Blockwise RingAttention, which leverages blockwise computation of self-attention and feedforward to distribute long sequences across multiple devices while fully overlapping the communication of key-value blocks with the computation of blockwise attention. Our approach enables training and inference of sequences that are up to device count times longer than those achievable by prior memory-efficient Transformers, without resorting to approximations or incurring additional communication and computation overheads. Extensive experiments on language modeling and reinforcement learning tasks demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in allowing millions of tokens context size and improving performance.",

Through the lens of discrete cosine transformation, we find the main reason is that the same noise level on a higher resolution results in a higher Signal-to-Noise Ratio in the frequency domain.

        "abstract": "Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) have shown great promise in learning node embeddings for link prediction (LP). While numerous studies aim to improve the overall LP performance of GNNs, none have explored its varying performance across different nodes and its underlying reasons. To this end, we aim to demystify which nodes will perform better from the perspective of their local topology. Despite the widespread belief that low-degree nodes exhibit poorer LP performance, our empirical findings provide nuances to this viewpoint and prompt us to propose a better metric, Topological Concentration (TC), based on the intersection of the local subgraph of each node with the ones of its neighbors. We empirically demonstrate that TC has a higher correlation with LP performance than other node-level topological metrics like degree and subgraph density, offering a better way to identify low-performing nodes than using degree. With TC, we discover a novel topological distribution shift issue in which newly joined neighbors of a node tend to become less interactive with that node\u2019s existing neighbors, compromising the generalizability of node embeddings for LP at testing time. To make the computation of TC scalable, We further propose Approximated Topological Concentration (ATC) and theoretically/empirically justify its efficacy in approximating TC and reducing the computation complexity. Given the positive correlation between node TC and its LP performance, we explore the potential of boosting LP performance via enhancing TC by re-weighting edges in the message-passing and discuss its effectiveness with limitations.

Additionally, two metrics, clustering information gain, and heuristic shape score are proposed to evaluate the model. Experiments are conducted on three abstract compositional visual object datasets, which require the model to utilize the compositionality of data instead of simply exploiting visual features. Then, three tasks on symbol grounding to predefined classes of parts and relations, as well as transfer learning to unseen classes, followed by a human evaluation, were carried out on these datasets. The results show that the proposed method discovers compositional patterns, which significantly outperforms the state-of-the-art unsupervised part segmentation methods that rely on visual features from pre-trained backbones.

        "title": "ZERO-MEAN REGULARIZED SPECTRAL CONTRASTIVE LEARNING: IMPLICITLY MITIGATING WRONG CON-",
        "abstract": "Contrastive learning has emerged as a popular paradigm of self-supervised learning that learns representations by encouraging representations of positive pairs to be similar while representations of negative pairs to be far apart. The spectral contrastive loss, in synergy with the notion of positive-pair graphs, offers valuable theoretical insights into the empirical successes of contrastive learning. In this paper, we propose incorporating an additive factor into the term of spectral contrastive loss involving negative pairs. This simple modification can be equivalently viewed as introducing a regularization term that enforces the mean of representations to be zero, which thus is referred to as zero-mean regularization. It intuitively relaxes the orthogonality of representations between negative pairs and implicitly alleviates the adverse effect of wrong connections in the positive-pair graph, leading to better performance and robustness. To clarify this, we thoroughly investigate the role of zero-mean regularized spectral contrastive loss in both unsupervised and supervised scenarios with respect to theoretical analysis and quantitative evaluation. These results highlight the potential of zero-mean regularized spectral contrastive learning to be a promising approach in various tasks.",

Numerous generalization bounds have been proposed in the literature as potential explanations for the ability of neural networks to generalize in the overparameterized setting. However, in their paper \u201cFantastic Generalization Measures and Where to Find Them,\u201d Jiang et al. (2020) examine more than a dozen generalization bounds, and show empirically that none of them are uniformly tight. This raises the question of whether uniformly-tight generalization bounds are at all possible in the overparameterized setting. We consider two types of generalization bounds: (1) bounds that may depend on the training set and the learned hypothesis (e.g., margin bounds). We prove mathematically that no such bound can be uniformly tight in the overparameterized setting; (2) bounds that may in addition also depend on the learning algorithm (e.g., stability bounds). For these bounds, we show a trade-off between the algorithm\u2019s performance and the bound\u2019s tightness. Namely, if the algorithm achieves good accuracy on certain distributions, then no generalization bound can be uniformly tight for it in the overparameterized setting.

        "abstract": "Existing NAS methods suffer from either an excessive amount of time for repetitive sampling and training of many task-irrelevant architectures. To tackle such limitations of existing NAS methods, we propose a paradigm shift from NAS to a novel conditional Neural Architecture Generation (NAG) framework based on diffusion models, dubbed DiffusionNAG. Specifically, we consider the neural architectures as directed graphs and propose a graph diffusion model for generating them. Moreover, with the guidance of parameterized predictors, DiffusionNAG can flexibly generate task-optimal architectures with the desired properties for diverse tasks, by sampling from a region that is more likely to satisfy the properties. This conditional NAG scheme is significantly more efficient than previous NAS schemes which sample the architectures and filter them using the property predictors. We validate the effectiveness of DiffusionNAG through extensive experiments in two predictor-based NAS scenarios: Transferable NAS and Bayesian Optimization (BO)-based NAS. DiffusionNAG achieves superior performance with speedups of up to 20\u00d7 when compared to the baselines on Transferable NAS benchmarks. Furthermore, when integrated into a BO-based algorithm, DiffusionNAG outperforms existing BO-based NAS approaches, particularly in the large MobileNetV3 search space on the ImageNet 1K dataset.",

However, the rationality of the diffusion process itself receives limited attention, leaving the question of whether the problem is well-posed and well-conditioned. In this paper, we explore a perplexing tendency of diffusion models: they often display the infinite Lipschitz property of the network with respect to time variable near the zero point. We provide theoretical proofs to illustrate the presence of infinite Lipschitz constants and empirical results to confirm it. The Lipschitz singularities pose a threat to the stability and accuracy during both the training and inference processes of diffusion models. Therefore, the mitigation of Lipschitz singularities holds great potential for enhancing the performance of diffusion models. To address this challenge, we propose a novel approach, dubbed E-TSDM, which alleviates the Lipschitz singularities of the diffusion model near the zero point of timesteps. Remarkably, our technique yields a substantial improvement in performance.

        "abstract": "The objective of domain generalization (DG) is to enhance the transferability of the model learned from a source domain to unobserved domains. To prevent overfitting to a specific domain, Sharpness-Aware Minimization (SAM) reduces source domain\u2019s loss sharpness. Although SAM variants have delivered significant improvements in DG, we highlight that there\u2019s still potential for improvement in generalizing to unknown domains through the exploration on data space. This paper introduces an objective rooted in both parameter and data perturbed regions for domain generalization, coined Unknown Domain Inconsistency Minimization (UDIM). UDIM reduces the loss landscape inconsistency between source domain and unknown domains. As unknown domains are inaccessible, these domains are empirically crafted by perturbing instances from the source domain dataset. In particular, by aligning the loss landscape acquired in the source domain to the loss landscape of perturbed domains, we expect to achieve generalization grounded on these flat minima for the unknown domains. Theoretically, we validate that merging SAM optimization with the UDIM objective establishes an upper bound for the true objective of the DG task. In an empirical aspect, UDIM consistently outperforms SAM variants across multiple DG benchmark datasets. Notably, UDIM shows statistically significant improvements in scenarios with more restrictive domain information, underscoring UDIM\u2019s generalization capability in unseen domains.

        "abstract": "Imposing known physical constraints, such as conservation laws, during neural network training introduces an inductive bias that can improve accuracy, reliability, convergence, and data efficiency for modeling physical dynamics. While such constraints can be softly imposed via loss function penalties, recent advancements in differentiable physics and optimization improve performance by incorporating PDE-constrained optimization as individual layers in neural networks. This enables a stricter adherence to physical constraints. However, imposing hard constraints significantly increases computational and memory costs, especially for complex dynamical systems. This is because it requires solving an optimization problem over a large number of points in a mesh, representing spatial and temporal discretizations, which greatly increases the complexity of the constraint. To address this challenge, we develop a scalable approach to enforce hard physical constraints using Mixture-of-Experts (MoE), which can be used with any neural network architecture. Our approach imposes the constraint over smaller decomposed domains, each of which is solved by an \u201cexpert\u201d through differentiable optimization. During training, each expert independently performs a localized backpropagation step by leveraging the implicit function theorem; the independence of each expert allows for parallelization across multiple GPUs. Compared to standard differentiable optimization, our scalable approach achieves greater accuracy in the neural PDE solver setting for predicting the dynamics of challenging non-linear systems. We also improve training stability and require significantly less computation time during both training and inference stages.",

        "abstract": "Offline Goal-Conditioned Reinforcement Learning (GCRL) is tasked with learning to achieve multiple goals in an environment purely from offline datasets using sparse reward functions. Offline GCRL is pivotal for developing generalist agents capable of leveraging pre-existing datasets to learn diverse and reusable skills without hand-engineering reward functions. However, contemporary approaches to GCRL based on supervised learning and contrastive learning are often suboptimal in the offline setting. An alternative perspective on GCRL optimizes for occupancy matching, but necessitates learning a discriminator, which subsequently serves as a pseudo-reward for downstream RL. Inaccuracies in the learned discriminator can cascade, negatively influencing the resulting policy. We present a novel approach to GCRL under a new lens of mixture-distribution matching, leading to our discriminator-free method: SMORe. The key insight is combining the occupancy matching perspective of GCRL with a convex dual formulation to derive a learning objective that can better leverage suboptimal offline data. SMORe learns scores or unnormalized densities representing the importance of taking an action at a state for reaching a particular goal. SMORe is principled and our extensive experiments on the fully offline GCRL benchmark composed of robot manipulation and locomotion tasks, including high-dimensional observations, show that SMORe can outperform state-of-the-art baselines by a significant margin.",

A popular approach towards obtaining such agents is to reuse skills learned in prior tasks to generalise compositionally to new ones. However, this is a challenging problem due to the curse of dimensionality induced by the combinatorially large number of ways high-level goals can be combined both logically and temporally in language. To address this problem, we propose a framework where an agent first learns a sufficient set of skill primitives to achieve all high-level goals in its environment. The agent can then flexibly compose them both logically and temporally to provably achieve temporal logic specifications in any regular language, such as regular fragments of linear temporal logic. This provides the agent with the ability to map from complex temporal logic task specifications to near-optimal behaviours zero-shot. We demonstrate this experimentally in a tabular setting, as well as in a high-dimensional video game and continuous control environment.

Recent Signed Distance Function (SDF)\u2013based methods demonstrated their ability to reconstruct accurate 3D shapes of Lambertian scenes.

To address the challenges, we propose a Gaussian-based representation of normals in SDF fields. Supervised by polarization priors, this representation guides the learning of geometry behind the specular reflection and captures more details than existing methods. Moreover, we propose a reweighting strategy in the optimization process to alleviate the noise issue of polarization priors. To validate the effectiveness of our design, we capture polarimetric information, and ground truth meshes in additional reflective scenes with various geometry.

Drawing inspiration from the knowledge-driven nature of human driving, we explore the question of how to instill similar capabilities into autonomous driving systems and summarize a paradigm that integrates an interactive environment, a driver agent, as well as a memory component to address this question. Leveraging large language models (LLMs) with emergent abilities, we propose the DiLu framework, which combines a Reasoning and a Reflection module to enable the system to perform decision-making based on common-sense knowledge and evolve continuously.

        "title": "GENERALIZATION: UNRAVELING LEARNING DIFFER-",
        "abstract": "This paper investigates discrepancies in how neural networks learn from different imaging domains, which are commonly overlooked when adopting computer vision techniques from the domain of natural images to other specialized domains such as medical images. Recent works have found that the generalization error of a trained network typically increases with the intrinsic dimension (ddata) of its training set. Yet, the steepness of this relationship varies significantly between medical (radiological) and natural imaging domains, with no existing theoretical explanation. We address this gap in knowledge by establishing and empirically validating a generalization scaling law with respect to ddata, and propose that the substantial scaling discrepancy between the two considered domains may be at least partially attributed to the higher intrinsic \u201clabel sharpness\u201d (KF ) of medical imaging datasets, a metric which we propose. Next, we demonstrate an additional benefit of measuring the label sharpness of a training set: it is negatively correlated with the trained model\u2019s adversarial robustness, which notably leads to models for medical images having a substantially higher vulnerability to adversarial attack. Finally, we extend our ddata formalism to the related metric of learned representation intrinsic dimension (drepr), derive a generalization scaling law with respect to drepr, and show that ddata serves as an upper bound for drepr.

Nonetheless, these existing transformer-based methods often neglect an essential aspect: the incorporation of uncertainty into the predicted series, which holds significant value in decisionmaking. In this paper, we introduce a Transformer-Modulated Diffusion Model (TMDM), uniting conditional diffusion generative process with transformers into a unified framework to enable precise distribution forecasting for MTS. TMDM harnesses the power of transformers to extract essential insights from historical time series data. This information is then utilized as prior knowledge, capturing covariate-dependence in both the forward and reverse processes within the diffusion model. Furthermore, we seamlessly integrate well-designed transformerbased forecasting methods into TMDM to enhance its overall performance.

        "abstract": "We deal with the combinatorial problem of learning directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure from observational data adhering to a linear structural equation model (SEM). Leveraging advances in differentiable, nonconvex characterizations of acyclicity, recent efforts have advocated a continuous constrained optimization paradigm to efficiently explore the space of DAGs. Most existing methods employ lasso-type score functions to guide this search, which (i) require expensive penalty parameter retuning when the unknown SEM noise variances change across problem instances; and (ii) implicitly rely on limiting homoscedasticity assumptions. In this work, we propose a new convex score function for sparsity-aware learning of linear DAGs, which incorporates concomitant estimation of scale and thus effectively decouples the sparsity parameter from the exogenous noise levels. Regularization via a smooth, nonconvex acyclicity penalty term yields CoLiDE (Concomitant Linear DAG Estimation), a regression-based criterion amenable to efficient gradient computation and closed-form estimation of noise variances in heteroscedastic scenarios. Our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art methods without incurring added complexity, especially when the DAGs are larger and the noise level profile is heterogeneous. We also find CoLiDE exhibits enhanced stability manifested via reduced standard deviations in several domain-specific metrics, underscoring the robustness of our novel linear DAG estimator.",

        "abstract": "Addressing the limitations of text as a source of accurate layout representation in text-conditional diffusion models, many works incorporate additional signals to condition certain attributes within a generated image. Although successful, previous works do not account for the specific localization of said attributes extended into the three dimensional plane. In this context, we present a conditional diffusion model that integrates control over three-dimensional object placement with disentangled representations of global stylistic semantics from multiple exemplar images. Specifically, we first introduce depth disentanglement training to leverage the relative depth of objects as an estimator, allowing the model to identify the absolute positions of unseen objects through the use of synthetic image triplets. We also introduce soft guidance, a method for imposing global semantics onto targeted regions without the use of any additional localization cues. Our integrated framework, COMPOSE AND CONQUER (CNC), unifies these techniques to localize multiple conditions in a disentangled manner. We demonstrate that our approach allows perception of objects at varying depths while offering a versatile framework for composing localized objects with different global semantics.",

Recently, neural operators have emerged as a promising technique to solve elliptic PDEs more efficiently by directly mapping the input to solutions. However, existing networks typically cannot handle complex geometries and inhomogeneous boundary values present in the real world. Here we introduce Boundary-Embedded Neural Operators (BENO), a novel neural operator architecture that embeds the complex geometries and inhomogeneous boundary values into the solving of elliptic PDEs. Inspired by classical Green\u2019s function, BENO consists of two branches of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) for interior source term and boundary values, respectively. Furthermore, a Transformer encoder maps the global boundary geometry into a latent vector which influences each message passing layer of the GNNs. We test our model extensively in elliptic PDEs with various boundary conditions. We show that all existing baseline methods fail to learn the solution operator. In contrast, our model, endowed with boundary-embedded architecture, outperforms state-of-the-art neural operators and strong baselines by an average of 60.96%.

        "abstract": "Programming-by-example is the task of synthesizing a program that is consistent with a set of user-provided input-output examples. As examples are often an under-specification of one\u2019s intent, a good synthesizer must choose the intended program from the many that are consistent with the given set of examples. Prior work frames program synthesis as a cooperative game between a listener (that synthesizes programs) and a speaker (a user choosing examples), and shows that models of computational pragmatic inference are effective in choosing the user intended programs. However, these models require counterfactual reasoning over a large set of programs and examples, which is infeasible in realistic program spaces. In this paper, we propose a novel way to amortize this search with neural networks. We sample pairs of programs and examples via self-play between listener and speaker models, and use pragmatic inference to choose informative training examples from this sample. We then use the informative dataset to train models to improve the synthesizer\u2019s ability to disambiguate user-provided examples without human supervision. We validate our method on the challenging task of synthesizing regular expressions from example strings, and find that our method (1) outperforms models trained without choosing pragmatic examples by 23% (a 51% relative increase) (2) matches the performance of supervised learning on a dataset of pragmatic examples provided by humans, despite using no human data in training.",

        "abstract": "K-means clustering is a widely used machine learning method for identifying patterns in large datasets. Semidefinite programming (SDP) relaxations have recently been proposed for solving the K-means optimization problem that enjoy strong statistical optimality guarantees, but the prohibitive cost of implementing an SDP solver renders these guarantees inaccessible to practical datasets. By contrast, nonnegative matrix factorization (NMF) is a simple clustering algorithm that is widely used by machine learning practitioners, but without a solid statistical underpinning nor rigorous guarantees. In this paper, we describe an NMF-like algorithm that works by solving a nonnegative low-rank restriction of the SDP relaxed K-means formulation using a nonconvex Burer\u2013Monteiro factorization approach. The resulting algorithm is just as simple and scalable as state-of-theart NMF algorithms, while also enjoying the same strong statistical optimality guarantees as the SDP.

        "title": "SLICEGPT: COMPRESS LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS",
        "abstract": "Large language models have become the cornerstone of natural language processing, but their use comes with substantial costs in terms of compute and memory resources. Sparsification provides a solution to alleviate these resource constraints, and recent works have shown that trained models can be sparsified post-hoc. Existing sparsification techniques face challenges as they need additional data structures and offer constrained speedup with current hardware. In this paper we present SliceGPT, a new post-training sparsification scheme which replaces each weight matrix with a smaller (dense) matrix, reducing the embedding dimension of the network. Through extensive experimentation, we show that SliceGPT can remove up to 25% of the model parameters (including embeddings) for OPT 66B and LLAMA-2 70B models with modest loss in accuracy (superior to 2:4 sparsity). Our sliced models run on fewer GPUs and run faster without any additional code optimization: on 24GB consumer GPUs we reduce the total compute for inference on LLAMA-2 70B to 64% of that of the dense model; on 40GB A100 GPUs we reduce it to 66%. We offer a new insight, computational invariance in transformer networks, which enables SliceGPT and we hope it will inspire and enable future avenues to reduce memory and computation demands for pre-trained models.",

        "abstract": "In federated learning (FL), data heterogeneity is one key bottleneck that causes model divergence and limits performance. Addressing this, existing methods often regard data heterogeneity as an inherent property and propose to mitigate its adverse effects by correcting models. In this paper, we seek to break this inherent property by generating data to complement the original dataset to fundamentally mitigate heterogeneity level. As a novel attempt from the perspective of data, we propose federated learning with consensus-oriented generation (FedCOG). FedCOG consists of two key components at the client side: complementary data generation, which generates data extracted from the shared global model to complement the original dataset, and knowledge-distillation-based model training, which distills knowledge from global model to local model based on the generated data to mitigate over-fitting the original heterogeneous dataset. FedCOG has two critical advantages: 1) it can be a plug-and-play module to further improve the performance of most existing FL methods, and 2) it is naturally compatible with standard FL protocols such as Secure Aggregation since it makes no modification in communication process. Extensive experiments on classical and real-world FL datasets show that FedCOG consistently outperforms state-of-the-art methods .",

        "title": "LMUFORMER: LOW COMPLEXITY YET POWERFUL SPIKING MODEL WITH LEGENDRE MEMORY UNITS",
        "abstract": "Transformer models have demonstrated high accuracy in numerous applications but have high complexity and lack sequential processing capability making them ill-suited for many streaming applications at the edge where devices are heavily resource-constrained. Thus motivated, many researchers have proposed reformulating the transformer models as RNN modules which modify the self-attention computation with explicit states. However, these approaches often incur significant performance degradation. The ultimate goal is to develop a model that has the following properties: parallel training, streaming and low-cost inference, and state-of-the-art (SOTA) performance. In this paper, we propose a new direction to achieve this goal. We show how architectural modifications to a fully-sequential recurrent model can help push its performance toward Transformer models while retaining its sequential processing capability. Specifically, inspired by the recent success of Legendre Memory Units (LMU) in sequence learning tasks, we propose LMUFormer, which augments the LMU with convolutional patch embedding and convolutional channel mixer. Moreover, we present a spiking version of this architecture, which introduces the benefit of states within the patch embedding and channel mixer modules while simultaneously reducing the computing complexity. We evaluated our architectures on multiple sequence datasets. Of particular note is our performance on the Speech Commands V2 dataset (35 classes). In comparison to SOTA transformer-based models within the ANN domain, our LMUFormer demonstrates comparable performance while necessitating a remarkable 53\u00d7 reduction in parameters and a substantial 65\u00d7 decrement in FLOPs. Furthermore, when benchmarked against extant low-complexity SNN variants, our model establishes a new SOTA with an accuracy of 96.12%. Additionally, owing to our model\u2019s proficiency in real-time data processing, we are able to achieve a 32.03% reduction in sequence length, all while incurring an inconsequential decline in performance.

        "abstract": "Diffusion models are capable of generating impressive images conditioned on text descriptions, and extensions of these models allow users to edit images at a relatively coarse scale. However, the ability to precisely edit the layout, position, pose, and shape of objects in images with diffusion models is still difficult. To this end, we propose motion guidance, a zero-shot technique that allows a user to specify dense, complex motion fields that indicate where each pixel in an image should move. Motion guidance works by steering the diffusion sampling process with the gradients through an off-the-shelf optical flow network. Specifically, we design a guidance loss that encourages the sample to have the desired motion, as estimated by a flow network, while also being visually similar to the source image. By simultaneously sampling from a diffusion model and guiding the sample to have low guidance loss, we can obtain a motion-edited image. We demonstrate that our technique works on complex motions and produces high quality edits of real and generated images.",

        "abstract": "Conventional causal discovery approaches, which seek to uncover causal relationships among measured variables, are typically sensitive to the presence of latent variables. While various methods have been developed to address this confounding issue, they often rely on strong assumptions about the underlying causal structure. In this paper, we consider a general scenario where measured and latent variables collectively form a partially observed causally sufficient linear system and latent variables may be anywhere in the causal structure. We theoretically show that with the aid of high-order statistics, the causal graph is (almost) fully identifiable if, roughly speaking, each latent set has a sufficient number of pure children, which can be either latent or measured. Naturally, LiNGAM, a model without latent variables, is encompassed as a special case. Based on the identification theorem, we develop a principled algorithm to identify the causal graph by testing for statistical independence involving only measured variables in specific manners. Experimental results show that our method effectively recovers the causal structure, even when latent variables are influenced by measured variables.",

        "abstract": "Generalizing to out-of-distribution (OOD) data or unseen domain, termed OOD generalization, still lacks appropriate theoretical guarantees. Canonical OOD bounds focus on different distance measurements between source and target domains but fail to consider the optimization property of the learned model. As empirically shown in recent work, the sharpness of learned minima influences OOD generalization. To bridge this gap between optimization and OOD generalization, we study the effect of sharpness on how a model tolerates data change in domain shift which is usually captured by \"robustness\" in generalization. In this paper, we give a rigorous connection between sharpness and robustness, which gives better OOD guarantees for robust algorithms. It also provides a theoretical backing for \"flat minima leads to better OOD generalization\". Overall, we propose a sharpness-based OOD generalization bound by taking robustness into consideration, resulting in a tighter bound than non-robust guarantees. Our findings are supported by the experiments on a ridge regression model, as well as the experiments on deep learning classification tasks.",

        "abstract": "Generative models have shown remarkable progress in 3D aspect. Recent works learn 3D representation explicitly under text-3D guidance. However, limited text3D data restricts the vocabulary scale and text control of generations. Generators may easily fall into a stereotype concept for certain text prompts, thus losing openvocabulary generation ability. To tackle this issue, we introduce a conditional 3D generative model, namely TextField3D.Specifically, rather than using the text prompts as input directly, we suggest to inject dynamic noise into the latent space of given text prompts, i.e., Noisy Text Fields (NTFs). In this way, limited 3D data can be mapped to the appropriate range of textual latent space that is expanded by NTFs. To this end, an NTFGen module is proposed to model general text latent code in noisy fields. Meanwhile, an NTFBind module is proposed to align viewinvariant image latent code to noisy fields, further supporting image-conditional 3D generation. To guide the conditional generation in both geometry and texture, multi-modal discrimination is constructed with a text-3D discriminator and a text2.5D discriminator. Compared to previous methods, TextField3D includes three merits: 1) large vocabulary, 2) text consistency, and 3) low latency.

Inspired by the recent success of diffusion models as means of learning and using priors over images, our model uses dendritic nonlinearities optimized for denoising, and stochastic somatic integration with the degree of noise modulated by an oscillating global signal. Combining these elements into a recurrent network yields a dynamical system that samples from the prior at a rate prescribed by the period of the global oscillator. Additional inputs reflecting sensory or top-down contextual information alter these dynamics to generate samples from the corresponding posterior, with different input gating patterns selecting different inference tasks.

        "abstract": "Hypernetworks, neural networks that predict the parameters of another neural network, are powerful models that have been successfully used in diverse applications from image generation to multi-task learning. Unfortunately, existing hypernetworks are often challenging to train. Training typically converges far more slowly than for non-hypernetwork models, and the rate of convergence can be very sensitive to hyperparameter choices. In this work, we identify a fundamental and previously unidentified problem that contributes to the challenge of training hypernetworks: a magnitude proportionality between the inputs and outputs of the hypernetwork. We demonstrate both analytically and empirically that this can lead to unstable optimization, thereby slowing down convergence, and sometimes even preventing any learning. We present a simple solution to this problem using a revised hypernetwork formulation that we call Magnitude Invariant Parametrizations (MIP). We demonstrate the proposed solution on several hypernetwork tasks, where it consistently stabilizes training and achieves faster convergence. Furthermore, we perform a comprehensive ablation study including choices of activation function, normalization strategies, input dimensionality, and hypernetwork architecture; and find that MIP improves training in all scenarios. We also provide easy-to-use code that can turn existing networks into MIP-based hypernetworks.",

        "abstract": "Due to privacy or patent concerns, a growing number of large models are released without granting access to their training data, making transferring their knowledge inefficient and problematic. In response, Data-Free Knowledge Distillation (DFKD) methods have emerged as direct solutions. However, simply adopting models derived from DFKD for real-world applications suffers significant performance degradation, due to the discrepancy between teachers\u2019 training data and real-world scenarios (student domain). The degradation stems from the portions of teachers\u2019 knowledge that are not applicable to the student domain. They are specific to the teacher domain and would undermine students\u2019 performance. Hence, selectively transferring teachers\u2019 appropriate knowledge becomes the primary challenge in DFKD. In this work, we propose a simple but effective method AuG-KD. It utilizes an uncertainty-guided and sample-specific anchor to align student-domain data with the teacher domain and leverages a generative method to progressively trade off the learning process between OOD knowledge distillation and domain-specific information learning via mixup learning. Extensive experiments in 3 datasets and 8 settings demonstrate the stability and superiority of our approach. Code available at https://github.com/IshiKura-a/AuG-KD",

        "abstract": "Despite the advancements of open-source large language models (LLMs), e.g., LLaMA, they remain significantly limited in tool-use capabilities, i.e., using external tools (APIs) to fulfill human instructions. The reason is that current instruction tuning largely focuses on basic language tasks but ignores the tool-use domain. This is in contrast to the excellent tool-use capabilities of state-of-the-art (SOTA) closed-source LLMs, e.g., ChatGPT. To bridge this gap, we introduce ToolLLM, a general tool-use framework encompassing data construction, model training, and evaluation. We first present ToolBench, an instruction-tuning dataset for tool use, which is constructed automatically using ChatGPT. Specifically, the construction can be divided into three stages: (i) API collection: we collect 16, 464 real-world RESTful APIs spanning 49 categories from RapidAPI Hub; (ii) instruction generation: we prompt ChatGPT to generate diverse instructions involving these APIs, covering both single-tool and multi-tool scenarios; (iii) solution path annotation: we use ChatGPT to search for a valid solution path (chain of API calls) for each instruction. To enhance the reasoning capabilities of LLMs, we develop a novel depth-first search-based decision tree algorithm. It enables LLMs to evaluate multiple reasoning traces and expand the search space. Moreover, to evaluate the tool-use capabilities of LLMs, we develop an automatic evaluator: ToolEval. Based on ToolBench, we fine-tune LLaMA to obtain an LLM ToolLLaMA, and equip it with a neural API retriever to recommend appropriate APIs for each instruction. Experiments show that ToolLLaMA demonstrates a remarkable ability to execute complex instructions and generalize to unseen APIs, and exhibits comparable performance to ChatGPT. Our ToolLLaMA also demonstrates strong zero-shot generalization ability in an out-of-distribution tool-use dataset: APIBench. The codes, trained models, and demo are publicly available at https://github.com/OpenBMB/ToolBench.",

        "abstract": "Generative pre-trained models have demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in language and vision domains by learning useful representations. In this paper, we extend the scope of this effectiveness by showing that visual robot manipulation can significantly benefit from large-scale video generative pre-training. We introduce GR-1, a GPT-style model designed for multi-task language-conditioned visual robot manipulation. GR-1 takes as inputs a language instruction, a sequence of observation images, and a sequence of robot states. It predicts robot actions as well as future images in an end-to-end manner. Thanks to a flexible design, GR-1 can be seamlessly finetuned on robot data after pre-trained on a large-scale video dataset. We perform extensive experiments on the challenging CALVIN benchmark and a real robot. On CALVIN benchmark, our method outperforms state-of-the-art baseline methods and improves the success rate from 88.9% to 94.9%. In the setting of zero-shot unseen scene generalization, GR-1 improves the success rate from 53.3% to 85.4%. In real robot experiments, GR-1 also outperforms baseline methods and shows strong potentials in generalization to unseen scenes and objects.

        "abstract": "High accuracy, low latency and high energy efficiency represent a set of conflicting goals when searching for system solutions for image classification and detection. While high-quality images naturally result in more precise detection and classification, they also result in a heavier computational workload for imaging and processing, reduced camera frame rates, and increased data communication between the camera and processor. Taking inspiration from the foveal-peripheral sampling mechanism, and saccade mechanism of the human visual system and the filling-in phenomena of brain, we have developed an active scene reconstruction architecture based on multiple foveal views. This model stitches together information from a sequence of foveal-peripheral views, which are sampled from multiple glances. Assisted by a reinforcement learning-based saccade mechanism, our model reduces the required input pixels by over 90% per frame while maintaining the same level of performance in image recognition as with the original images. We evaluated the effectiveness of our model using the GTSRB dataset and the ImageNet dataset. Using an equal number of input pixels, our model demonstrates a 5% higher image recognition accuracy compared to state-of-theart foveal-peripheral based vision systems. Furthermore, we demonstrate that our foveal sampling/saccadic scene reconstruction model exhibits significantly lower complexity and higher data efficiency during the training phase compared to existing approaches.

        "abstract": "We seek to uncover the latent interest units from behavioral data to better learn user preferences under the VAE framework. Existing practices tend to ignore the multiple facets of item characteristics, which may not capture it at appropriate granularity. Moreover, current studies equate the granularity of item space to that of user interests, which we postulate is not ideal as user interests would likely map to a small subset of item space. In addition, the compositionality of user interests has received inadequate attention, preventing the modeling of interactions between explanatory factors driving a user\u2019s decision. To resolve this, we propose to align user interests with multi-faceted item characteristics. First, we involve prototype-based representation learning to discover item characteristics along multiple facets. Second, we compose user interests from uncovered item characteristics via binding mechanism, separating the granularity of user preferences from that of item space. Third, we design a dedicated bi-directional binding block, aiding the derivation of compositional user interests. On real-world datasets, the experimental results demonstrate the strong performance of our proposed method compared to a series of baselines.",

It addresses the shortcomings of existing VAE-based models, which often ignore the multiple facets of item characteristics and assume the granularity of item space equals that of user interests. FACETVAE involves prototype-based representation learning to discover item characteristics along multiple facets, binding compositional user interests from uncovered item characteristics, and a bi-directional binding block to derive compositional user interests. The experimental results demonstrate the strong performance of FACETVAE compared to a series of baselines on real-world datasets.\n\nStrengths: The paper provides a novel approach to learning multi-faceted user interests, addressing the shortcomings of existing VAE-based models. The proposed FACETVAE framework is well-structured, and the experimental results demonstrate its effectiveness.\n\nWeaknesses: The paper assumes uniform facet distribution, which may not hold in all cases. The complexity of the FACETVAE framework may be high, which could be a limitation in terms of efficiency. The paper also assumes that the number of item groups under each facet differs, which may not be the case in all scenarios.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement: To improve the FACETVAE framework, consider using more robust methods to discover item characteristics along multiple facets, such as using clustering algorithms or dimensionality reduction techniques. Additionally, consider using more efficient methods to bind compositional user interests, such as using attention mechanisms or graph-based methods. Finally, consider using more robust methods to estimate the number of facets and the number of clusters per facet in a data-driven manner.\n\nRecommendation: FACETVAE is a novel and effective approach to learning multi-faceted user interests. While it has some limitations, it has the potential to improve the performance of VAE-based models in real-world scenarios. Therefore, I recommend that the authors continue to work on improving the FACETVAE framework and exploring its potential applications. \n\n$$$",

        "abstract": "The transferability of deep neural networks (DNNs) has made significant progress in image and language processing. However, due to the heterogeneity among tables, such DNN bonus is still far from being well exploited on tabular data prediction (e.g., regression or classification tasks). Condensing knowledge from diverse domains, language models (LMs) possess the capability to comprehend feature names from various tables, potentially serving as versatile learners in transferring knowledge across distinct tables and diverse prediction tasks, but their discrete text representation space is inherently incompatible with numerical feature values in tables. In this paper, we present TP-BERTa, a specifically pre-trained LM for tabular data prediction. Concretely, a novel relative magnitude tokenization converts scalar numerical feature values to finely discrete, high-dimensional tokens, and an intra-feature attention approach integrates feature values with the corresponding feature names. Comprehensive experiments demonstrate that our pre-trained TP-BERTa leads the performance among tabular DNNs and is competitive with Gradient Boosted Decision Tree models in typical tabular data regime.",

        "abstract": "Distributed optimization (DO) approaches for saddle point problems (SPP) have recently gained in popularity due to the critical role they play in machine learning (ML). Existing works mostly target smooth unconstrained objectives in Euclidean space, whereas ML problems often involve constraints or non-smooth regularization, which results in a need for composite optimization. Moreover, although non-smooth regularization often serves to induce structure (e.g., sparsity), standard aggregation schemes in distributed optimization break this structure. Addressing these issues, we propose Federated Dual Extrapolation (FeDualEx), an extra-step primal-dual algorithm with local updates, which is the first of its kind to encompass both saddle point optimization and composite objectives under the distributed paradigm. Using a generalized notion of Bregman divergence, we analyze its convergence and communication complexity in the homogeneous setting. Furthermore, the empirical evaluation demonstrates the effectiveness of FeDualEx for inducing structure in these challenging settings.",

Our proposed defense is built upon an intriguing concept: given a backdoored model, we reverse engineer it to directly extract its backdoor functionality to a backdoor expert model. To accomplish this, we finetune the backdoored model over a small set of intentionally mislabeled clean samples, such that it unlearns the normal functionality while still preserving the backdoor functionality, and thus resulting in a model (dubbed a backdoor expert model) that can only recognize backdoor inputs. Based on the extracted backdoor expert model, we show the feasibility of devising robust backdoor input detectors that filter out the backdoor inputs during model inference. Further augmented by an ensemble strategy with a finetuned auxiliary model, our defense, BaDExpert (Backdoor Input Detection with Backdoor Expert), effectively mitigates 17 SOTA backdoor attacks while minimally impacting clean utility. The effectiveness of BaDExpert has been verified on multiple datasets (CIFAR10, GTSRB, and ImageNet) across multiple model architectures (ResNet, VGG, MobileNetV2, and Vision Transformer).

        "abstract": "Deep long-tailed recognition (DLTR) has attracted much attention due to its close touch with realistic scenarios. Recent advances have focused on re-balancing across various aspects, e.g., sampling strategy, loss re-weighting, logit adjustment, and input/parameter perturbation, etc. However, few studies have considered dynamic re-balancing to address intrinsic optimization conflicts, which are identified as prevalent and critical issues in this study. In this paper, we empirically establish the severity of the optimization conflict issue in the DLTR scenario, which leads to a degradation of representation learning. This observation serves as the motivation for pursuing Pareto optimal solutions. Unfortunately, a straightforward integration of multi-objective optimization (MOO) with DLTR methods is infeasible due to the disparity between multi-task learning (MTL) and DLTR. Therefore, we propose effective alternatives by decoupling MOO-based MTL from a temporal perspective rather than a structural one. Furthermore, we enhance the integration of MOO and DLTR by investigating the generalization and convergence problems. Specifically, we propose optimizing the variability collapse loss, guided by the derived MOObased DLTR generalization bound, to improve generalization. Additionally, we anticipate worst-case optimization to ensure convergence. Building upon the proposed MOO framework, we introduce a novel method called Pareto deep LOngTailed recognition (PLOT). Extensive evaluations demonstrate that our method not only generally improves mainstream pipelines, but also achieves an augmented version to realize state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks.

Previous research typically gathered human preference data and then aligned the pre-trained models using reinforcement learning or instruction tuning, a.k.a. the finetuning step. In contrast, aligning frozen LLMs without requiring alignment data is more appealing. This work explores the potential of the latter setting. We discover that by integrating self-evaluation and rewind mechanisms, unaligned LLMs can directly produce responses consistent with human preferences via self-boosting. We introduce a novel inference method, Rewindable Auto-regressive INference (RAIN), that allows pre-trained LLMs to evaluate their own generation and use the evaluation results to guide rewind and generation for AI safety. Notably, RAIN operates without the need of extra data for model alignment and abstains from any training, gradient computation, or parameter updates. Experimental results evaluated by GPT-4 and humans demonstrate the effectiveness of RAIN: on the HH dataset, RAIN improves the harmlessness rate of LLaMA 30B from 82% of vanilla inference to 97%, while maintaining the helpfulness rate.

To the best of our knowledge, this work is the first to study the robustness of diffusion models to MIA in the TTS task.

While existing FR algorithms primarily focus on optimizing margins and loss functions, limited attention has been given to exploring the feature representation space. Therefore, this paper endeavors to improve FR performance in the view of feature representation space. Firstly, we consider two FR models that exhibit distinct performance discrepancies, where one model exhibits superior recognition accuracy compared to the other. We implement orthogonal decomposition on the features from the superior model along those from the inferior model and obtain two sub-features. Surprisingly, we find the sub-feature orthogonal to the inferior still possesses a certain level of face distinguishability. We adjust the modulus of the sub-features and recombine them through vector addition. Experiments demonstrate this recombination is likely to contribute to an improved facial feature representation, even better than features from the original superior model. Motivated by this discovery, we further consider how to improve FR accuracy when there is only one FR model available. Inspired by knowledge distillation, we incorporate the intraclass incoherence constraint (IIC) to solve the problem.

However, typical GT models have at least quadratic complexity and thus cannot scale to large graphs. While there are several linear GTs recently proposed, they still lag behind GNN counterparts on several popular graph datasets, which poses a critical concern on their practical expressivity. To balance the trade-off between expressivity and scalability of GTs, we propose Polynormer, a polynomialexpressive GT model with linear complexity. Polynormer is built upon a novel base model that learns a high-degree polynomial on input features. To enable the base model permutation equivariant, we integrate it with graph topology and node features separately, resulting in local and global equivariant attention models. Consequently, Polynormer adopts a linear local-to-global attention scheme to learn high-degree equivariant polynomials whose coefficients are controlled by attention scores. Polynormer has been evaluated on 13 homophilic and heterophilic datasets, including large graphs with millions of nodes.

        "abstract": "3D visual grounding is the ability to localize objects in 3D scenes conditioned by utterances. Most existing methods devote the referring head to localize the referred object directly, causing failure in complex scenarios. In addition, it does not illustrate how and why the network reaches the final decision. In this paper, we address this question \u201cCan we design an interpretable 3D visual grounding framework that has the potential to mimic the human perception system?\u201d. To this end, we formulate the 3D visual grounding problem as a sequence-to-sequence (Seq2Seq) task by first predicting a chain of anchors and then the final target. Interpretability not only improves the overall performance but also helps us identify failure cases. Following the chain of thoughts approach enables us to decompose the referring task into interpretable intermediate steps, boosting the performance and making our framework extremely data-efficient. Moreover, our proposed framework can be easily integrated into any existing architecture. We validate our approach through comprehensive experiments on the Nr3D, Sr3D, and Scanrefer benchmarks and show consistent performance gains compared to existing methods without requiring manually annotated data. Furthermore, our proposed framework, dubbed CoT3DRef, is significantly data-efficient, whereas on the Sr3D dataset, when trained only on 10% of the data, we match the SOTA performance that trained on the entire data.

        "abstract": "In Causal Bayesian Optimization (CBO), an agent intervenes on a structural causal model with known graph but unknown mechanisms to maximize a downstream reward variable. In this paper, we consider the generalization where other agents or external events also intervene on the system, which is key for enabling adaptiveness to non-stationarities such as weather changes, market forces, or adversaries. We formalize this generalization of CBO as Adversarial Causal Bayesian Optimization (ACBO) and introduce the first algorithm for ACBO with bounded regret: Causal Bayesian Optimization with Multiplicative Weights (CBO-MW). Our approach combines a classical online learning strategy with causal modeling of the rewards. To achieve this, it computes optimistic counterfactual reward estimates by propagating uncertainty through the causal graph. We derive regret bounds for CBO-MW that naturally depend on graph-related quantities. We further propose a scalable implementation for the case of combinatorial interventions and submodular rewards. Empirically, CBO-MW outperforms non-causal and non-adversarial Bayesian optimization methods on synthetic environments and environments based on real-word data. Our experiments include a realistic demonstration of how CBO-MW can be used to learn users\u2019 demand patterns in a shared mobility system and reposition vehicles in strategic areas.",

It presents a unique hybrid of chain-of-thought (CoT) and program-of-thought (PoT) rationales, and also ensures extensive coverage of diverse fields in math. The hybrid of CoT and PoT not only unleashes the potential of tool use but also allows different thought processes for different math problems. As a result, the MAmmoTH series substantially outperform existing open-source models on nine mathematical reasoning datasets across all scales with an average accuracy gain between 16% and 32%. Remarkably, our MAmmoTH-7B model reaches 33% on MATH (a competition-level dataset), which exceeds the best open-source 7B model (WizardMath) by 23%, and the MAmmoTH-34B model achieves 44% accuracy on MATH, even surpassing GPT4\u2019s CoT result. Our work underscores the importance of diverse problem coverage and the use of hybrid rationales in developing superior math generalist models.",

By assuming the entire LM output sequence as a single action, A-LOL allows incorporating sequence-level classifiers or human-designed scoring functions as rewards. Subsequently, by using LM\u2019s value estimate, A-LOL only trains on positive advantage (leftover) data points, making it resilient to noise. Overall, A-LOL is an easy-to-implement, sample-efficient, and stable LM training recipe. We demonstrate the effectiveness of A-LOL and its variants with a set of four different language generation tasks. We compare against both online RL (PPO) and recent preference-based (DPO, PRO) and reward-based (GOLD) offline RL baselines. On the commonly-used RLHF benchmark, Helpful and Harmless Assistant (HHA), LMs trained with A-LOL methods achieve the highest diversity while also being rated more safe and helpful than the baselines according to humans.

        "abstract": "Imagining the future trajectory is the key for robots to make sound planning and successfully reach their goals. Therefore, text-conditioned video prediction (TVP) is an essential task to facilitate general robot policy learning. To tackle this task and empower robots with the ability to foresee the future, we propose a sample and computation-efficient model, named Seer, by inflating the pretrained text-toimage (T2I) stable diffusion models along the temporal axis. We enhance the U-Net and language conditioning model by incorporating computation-efficient spatial-temporal attention. Furthermore, we introduce a novel Frame Sequential Text Decomposer module that dissects a sentence\u2019s global instruction into temporally aligned sub-instructions, ensuring precise integration into each frame of generation. Our framework allows us to effectively leverage the extensive prior knowledge embedded in pretrained T2I models across the frames. With the adaptable-designed architecture, Seer makes it possible to generate high-fidelity, coherent, and instruction-aligned video frames by fine-tuning a few layers on a small amount of data. The experimental results on Something Something V2 (SSv2), Bridgedata and EpicKitchens-100 datasets demonstrate our superior video prediction performance with around 480-GPU hours versus CogVideo with over 12,480-GPU hours: achieving the 31% FVD improvement compared to the current SOTA model on SSv2 and 83.7% average preference in the human evaluation.

This paper introduces PIXART-\u03b1, a Transformer-based T2I diffusion model whose image generation quality is competitive with state-of-the-art image generators (e.g., Imagen, SDXL, and even Midjourney), reaching near-commercial application standards. Additionally, it supports high-resolution image synthesis up to 1024 \u00d7 1024 resolution with low training cost, as shown in Figure 1 and 2. To achieve this goal, three core designs are proposed: (1) Training strategy decomposition: We devise three distinct training steps that respectively optimize pixel dependency, textimage alignment, and image aesthetic quality; (2) Efficient T2I Transformer: We incorporate cross-attention modules into Diffusion Transformer (DiT) to inject text conditions and streamline the computation-intensive class-condition branch; (3) High-informative data: We emphasize the significance of concept density in text-image pairs and leverage a large Vision-Language model to auto-label dense pseudo-captions to assist text-image alignment learning. As a result, PIXART-\u03b1\u2019s training speed markedly surpasses existing large-scale T2I models, e.g., PIXART\u03b1 only takes 12% of Stable Diffusion v1.5\u2019s training time (\u223c753 vs. \u223c6,250 A100 GPU days), saving nearly $300,000 ($28,400 vs. $320,000) and reducing 90% CO2 emissions.

In this work, we introduce a scheduling strategy that, to our knowledge, is the first to successfully achieve zero pipeline bubbles under synchronous training semantics. The key idea behind this improvement is to split the backward computation into two parts, one that computes gradient for the input and another that computes for the parameters. Based on this idea, we handcraft novel pipeline schedules that significantly outperform the baseline methods. We further develop an algorithm that automatically finds an optimal schedule based on specific model configuration and memory limit. Additionally, to truly achieve zero bubble, we introduce a novel technique to bypass synchronizations during the optimizer step. Experimental evaluations show that our method outperforms the 1F1B schedule up to 15% in throughput under a similar memory limit. This number can be further pushed to 30% when the memory constraint is relaxed. We believe our results mark a major step forward in harnessing the true potential of pipeline parallelism.

        "abstract": "Deep neural networks are susceptible to adversarial attacks, which can compromise their performance and accuracy. Adversarial Training (AT) has emerged as a popular approach for protecting neural networks against such attacks. However, a key challenge of AT is robust overfitting, where the network\u2019s robust performance on test data deteriorates with further training, thus hindering generalization. Motivated by the concept of active forgetting in the brain, we introduce a novel learning paradigm called \u201cForget to Mitigate Overfitting (FOMO)\". FOMO alternates between the forgetting phase, which randomly forgets a subset of weights and regulates the model\u2019s information through weight reinitialization, and the relearning phase, which emphasizes learning generalizable features. Our experiments on benchmark datasets and adversarial attacks show that FOMO alleviates robust overfitting by significantly reducing the gap between the best and last robust test accuracy while improving the state-of-the-art robustness. Furthermore, FOMO provides a better trade-off between standard and robust accuracy, outperforming baseline adversarial methods. Finally, our framework is robust to AutoAttacks and increases generalization in many real-world scenarios.1",

In contrast, the realm of Optimal Transport (OT) and, in particular, neural OT solvers is much less explored and limited by few recent works (excluding WGAN-based approaches which utilize OT as a loss function and do not model OT maps themselves). In our work, we bridge the gap between EBMs and Entropy-regularized OT. We present a novel methodology which allows utilizing the recent developments and technical improvements of the former in order to enrich the latter. From the theoretical perspective, we prove generalization bounds for our technique. In practice, we validate its applicability in toy 2D and image domains.

        "abstract": "Semi-supervised learning (SSL) has witnessed great progress with various improvements in the self-training framework with pseudo labeling. The main challenge is how to distinguish high-quality pseudo labels against the confirmation bias. However, existing pseudo-label selection strategies are limited to pre-defined schemes or complex hand-crafted policies specially designed for classification, failing to achieve high-quality labels, fast convergence, and task versatility simultaneously. To these ends, we propose a Semi-supervised Reward framework (SemiReward) that predicts reward scores to evaluate and filter out high-quality pseudo labels, which is pluggable to mainstream SSL methods in wide task types and scenarios. To mitigate confirmation bias, SemiReward is trained online in two stages with a generator model and subsampling strategy. With classification and regression tasks on 13 standard SSL benchmarks across three modalities, extensive experiments verify that SemiReward achieves significant performance gains and faster convergence speeds upon Pseudo Label, FlexMatch, and Free/SoftMatch.

        "title": "META-LEARNING PRIORS USING UNROLLED PROXIMAL NETWORKS",
        "abstract": "Relying on prior knowledge accumulated from related tasks, meta-learning offers a powerful approach to learning a novel task from limited training data. Recent approaches parameterize the prior with a family of probability density functions or recurrent neural networks, whose parameters can be optimized by utilizing validation data from the observed tasks. While these approaches have appealing empirical performance, the expressiveness of their prior is relatively low, which limits the generalization and interpretation of meta-learning. Aiming at expressive yet meaningful priors, this contribution puts forth a novel prior representation model that leverages the notion of algorithm unrolling. The key idea is to unroll the proximal gradient descent steps, where learnable piecewise linear functions are developed to approximate the desired proximal operators within tight theoretical error bounds established for both smooth and non-smooth proximal functions. The resultant multi-block neural network not only broadens the scope of learnable priors, but also enhances interpretability from an optimization viewpoint. Numerical tests conducted on few-shot learning datasets demonstrate markedly improved performance with flexible, visualizable, and understandable priors.",

In contrast to prior tactile simulators which primarily focus on manipulating rigid bodies and often rely on simplified approximations to model stress and deformations of materials in contact, DIFFTACTILE emphasizes physics-based contact modeling with high fidelity, supporting simulations of diverse contact modes and interactions with objects possessing a wide range of material properties. Our system incorporates several key components, including a Finite Element Method (FEM)-based soft body model for simulating the sensing elastomer, a multi-material simulator for modeling diverse object types (such as elastic, elastoplastic, cables) under manipulation, a penalty-based contact model for handling contact dynamics. The differentiable nature of our system facilitates gradient-based optimization for both 1) refining physical properties in simulation using real-world data, hence narrowing the sim-to-real gap and 2) efficient learning of tactile-assisted grasping and contact-rich manipulation skills. Additionally, we introduce a method to infer the optical response of our tactile sensor to contact using an efficient pixel-based neural module. We anticipate that DIFFTACTILE will serve as a useful platform for studying contact-rich manipulations, leveraging the benefits of dense tactile feedback and differentiable physics.

However, recent progress on multi-order game-theoretic interaction within deep neural networks (DNNs) reveals the representation bottleneck of modern ConvNets, where the expressive interactions have not been effectively encoded with the increased kernel size. To tackle this challenge, we propose a new family of modern ConvNets, dubbed MogaNet, for discriminative visual representation learning in pure ConvNet-based models with favorable complexity-performance trade-offs.

        "abstract": "Self-supervised learning (SSL) has recently emerged as a promising paradigm for training generalisable models on large-scale data in the fields of vision, text, and speech. Although SSL has been proven effective in speech and audio, its application to music audio has yet to be thoroughly explored. This is partially due to the distinctive challenges associated with modelling musical knowledge, particularly tonal and pitched characteristics of music. To address this research gap, we propose an acoustic Music undERstanding model with large-scale self-supervised Training (MERT), which incorporates teacher models to provide pseudo labels in the masked language modelling (MLM) style acoustic pre-training. In our exploration, we identified an effective combination of teacher models, which outperforms conventional speech and audio approaches in terms of performance. This combination includes an acoustic teacher based on Residual Vector Quantisation Variational AutoEncoder (RVQ-VAE) and a musical teacher based on the ConstantQ Transform (CQT). Furthermore, we explore a wide range of settings to overcome the instability in acoustic language model pre-training, which allows our designed paradigm to scale from 95M to 330M parameters. Experimental results indicate that our model can generalise and perform well on 14 music understanding tasks and attain state-of-the-art (SOTA) overall scores.",

        "abstract": "Sorting is a fundamental operation of all computer systems, having been a longstanding significant research topic. Beyond the problem formulation of traditional sorting algorithms, we consider sorting problems for more abstract yet expressive inputs, e.g., multi-digit images and image fragments, through a neural sorting network. To learn a mapping from a high-dimensional input to an ordinal variable, the differentiability of sorting networks needs to be guaranteed. In this paper we define a softening error by a differentiable swap function, and develop an error-free swap function that holds a non-decreasing condition and differentiability. Furthermore, a permutation-equivariant Transformer network with multi-head attention is adopted to capture dependency between given inputs and also leverage its model capacity with self-attention. Experiments on diverse sorting benchmarks show that our methods perform better than or comparable to baseline methods.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies have highlighted the potential of Lipschitz-based methods for training certifiably robust neural networks against adversarial attacks. A key challenge, supported both theoretically and empirically, is that robustness demands greater network capacity and more data than standard training. However, effectively adding capacity under stringent Lipschitz constraints has proven more difficult than it may seem, evident by the fact that state-of-the-art approach tend more towards underfitting than overfitting. Moreover, we posit that a lack of careful exploration of the design space for Lipshitz-based approaches has left potential performance gains on the table. In this work, we provide a more comprehensive evaluation to better uncover the potential of Lipschitz-based certification methods. Using a combination of novel techniques, design optimizations, and synthesis of prior work, we are able to significantly improve the state-of-the-art VRA for deterministic certification on a variety of benchmark datasets, and over a range of perturbation sizes. Of particular note, we discover that the addition of large \u201cCholesky-orthogonalized residual dense\u201d layers to the end of existing state-of-the-art Lipschitz-controlled ResNet architectures is especially effective for increasing network capacity and performance. Combined with filtered generative data augmentation, our final results further the state of the art deterministic VRA by up to 8.5 percentage points.",

        "abstract": "Designing effective positional encodings for graphs is key to building powerful graph transformers and enhancing message-passing graph neural networks. Although widespread, using Laplacian eigenvectors as positional encodings faces two fundamental challenges: (1) Non-uniqueness: there are many different eigendecompositions of the same Laplacian, and (2) Instability: small perturbations to the Laplacian could result in completely different eigenspaces, leading to unpredictable changes in positional encoding. Despite many attempts to address nonuniqueness, most methods overlook stability, leading to poor generalization on unseen graph structures. We identify the cause of instability to be a \u201chard partition\u201d of eigenspaces. Hence, we introduce Stable and Expressive Positional Encodings (SPE), an architecture for processing eigenvectors that uses eigenvalues to \u201csoftly partition\u201d eigenspaces. SPE is the first architecture that is (1) provably stable, and (2) universally expressive for basis invariant functions whilst respecting all symmetries of eigenvectors. Besides guaranteed stability, we prove that SPE is at least as expressive as existing methods, and highly capable of counting graph structures.

        "title": "GEOLLM: EXTRACTING GEOSPATIAL KNOWLEDGE FROM LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS",
        "abstract": "The application of machine learning (ML) in a range of geospatial tasks is increasingly common but often relies on globally available covariates such as satellite imagery that can either be expensive or lack predictive power. Here we explore the question of whether the vast amounts of knowledge found in Internet language corpora, now compressed within large language models (LLMs), can be leveraged for geospatial prediction tasks. We first demonstrate that LLMs embed remarkable spatial information about locations, but naively querying LLMs using geographic coordinates alone is ineffective in predicting key indicators like population density. We then present GeoLLM, a novel method that can effectively extract geospatial knowledge from LLMs with auxiliary map data from OpenStreetMap. We demonstrate the utility of our approach across multiple tasks of central interest to the international community, including the measurement of population density and economic livelihoods. Across these tasks, our method demonstrates a 70% improvement in performance (measured using Pearson\u2019s r) relative to baselines that use nearest neighbors or use information directly from the prompt, and performance equal to or exceeding satellite-based benchmarks in the literature. With GeoLLM, we observe that GPT-3.5 outperforms Llama 2 and RoBERTa by 19% and 51% respectively, suggesting that the performance of our method scales well with the size of the model and its pretraining dataset. Our experiments reveal that LLMs are remarkably sample-efficient, rich in geospatial information, and robust across the globe. Crucially, GeoLLM shows promise in mitigating the limitations of existing geospatial covariates and complementing them well.

The method may not be effective for datasets with abundant spectral channel information, such as remote sensing datasets.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. To address the limitation of the method requiring prior knowledge, consider using transfer learning or few-shot learning techniques.\n2. To improve the effectiveness of the learnable mask, consider using a more sophisticated masking strategy, such as a dynamic mask or a mask that adapts to the target object.\n3. To address the training challenges introduced by the kernel-level weight binarization technique, consider using a different binarization technique or a more sensitive optimizer.\n4. To improve the performance of the method at very low under-sampling rates, consider using a different under-sampling strategy or a more efficient patch-embedding layer.\n5. To address the limitation of the method being less effective for datasets with abundant spectral channel information, consider using a different approach, such as using a hyperspectral-specific model or a model that is designed to handle datasets with abundant spectral channel information.\n\nRecommendation:\nThe approach is novel and effective in reducing data acquisition volume using pre-acquisition modulation. However, the method has limitations and requires further improvement to be effective in certain scenarios. With further research and development, LUM-ViT has the potential to be a significant contribution to the field of hyperspectral image classification and data acquisition.",

        "title": "CURRICULUM REINFORCEMENT LEARNING FOR QUANTUM ARCHITECTURE SEARCH UNDER HARD-",
        "abstract": "The key challenge in the noisy intermediate-scale quantum era is finding useful circuits compatible with current device limitations. Variational quantum algorithms (VQAs) offer a potential solution by fixing the circuit architecture and optimizing individual gate parameters in an external loop. However, parameter optimization can become intractable, and the overall performance of the algorithm depends heavily on the initially chosen circuit architecture. Several quantum architecture search (QAS) algorithms have been developed to design useful circuit architectures automatically. In the case of parameter optimization alone, noise effects have been observed to dramatically influence the performance of the optimizer and final outcomes, which is a key line of study. However, the effects of noise on the architecture search, which could be just as critical, are poorly understood. This work addresses this gap by introducing a curriculum-based reinforcement learning QAS (CRLQAS) algorithm designed to tackle challenges in realistic VQA deployment. The algorithm incorporates (i) a 3D architecture encoding and restrictions on environment dynamics to explore the search space of possible circuits efficiently, (ii) an episode halting scheme to steer the agent to find shorter circuits, and (iii) a novel variant of simultaneous perturbation stochastic approximation as an optimizer for faster convergence. To facilitate studies, we developed an optimized simulator for our algorithm, significantly improving computational efficiency in simulating noisy quantum circuits by employing the Pauli-transfer matrix formalism in the Pauli-Liouville basis. Numerical experiments focusing on quantum chemistry tasks demonstrate that CRLQAS outperforms existing QAS algorithms across several metrics in both noiseless and noisy environments.",

        "title": "GIM: LEARNING GENERALIZABLE IMAGE MATCHER",
        "abstract": "Image matching is a fundamental computer vision problem. While learning-based methods achieve state-of-the-art performance on existing benchmarks, they generalize poorly to in-the-wild images. Such methods typically need to train separate models for different scene types (e.g., indoor vs. outdoor) and are impractical when the scene type is unknown in advance. One of the underlying problems is the limited scalability of existing data construction pipelines, which limits the diversity of standard image matching datasets. To address this problem, we propose GIM, a self-training framework for learning a single generalizable model based on any image matching architecture using internet videos, an abundant and diverse data source. Given an architecture, GIM first trains it on standard domain-specific datasets and then combines it with complementary matching methods to create dense labels on nearby frames of novel videos. These labels are filtered by robust fitting, and then enhanced by propagating them to distant frames. The final model is trained on propagated data with strong augmentations. Not relying on complex 3D reconstruction makes GIM much more efficient and less likely to fail than standard SfM-and-MVS based frameworks. We also propose ZEB, the first zero-shot evaluation benchmark for image matching. By mixing data from diverse domains, ZEB can thoroughly assess the cross-domain generalization performance of different methods. Experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and generality of GIM. Applying GIM consistently improves the zero-shot performance of 3 state-of-theart image matching architectures as the number of downloaded videos increases (Fig. 1 (a)); with 50 hours of YouTube videos, the relative zero-shot performance improves by 8.4% \u2212 18.1%. GIM also enables generalization to extreme crossdomain data such as Bird Eye View (BEV) images of projected 3D point clouds (Fig. 1 (c)). More importantly, our single zero-shot model consistently outperforms domain-specific baselines when evaluated on downstream tasks inherent to their respective domains. The code will be released upon acceptance.",

Such objects and scenarios might not be present in the robot\u2019s own training data. We propose SuSIE, a method that leverages an image editing diffusion model to act as a high-level planner by proposing intermediate subgoals that a low-level controller attains. Specifically, we fine-tune InstructPix2Pix on robot data such that it outputs a hypothetical future observation given the robot\u2019s current observation and a language command. We then use the same robot data to train a low-level goalconditioned policy to reach a given image observation. We find that when these components are combined, the resulting system exhibits robust generalization capabilities. The high-level planner utilizes its Internet-scale pre-training and visual understanding to guide the low-level goal-conditioned policy, achieving significantly better generalization than conventional language-conditioned policies. We demonstrate that this approach solves real robot control tasks involving novel objects, distractors, and even environments, both in the real world and in simulation.

        "abstract": "This work presents an information-theoretic perspective to group fairness trade-offs in federated learning (FL) with respect to sensitive attributes, such as gender, race, etc. Existing works often focus on either global fairness (overall disparity of the model across all clients) or local fairness (disparity of the model at each client), without always considering their trade-offs. There is a lack of understanding of the interplay between global and local fairness in FL, particularly under data heterogeneity, and if and when one implies the other. To address this gap, we leverage a body of work in information theory called partial information decomposition (PID), which first identifies three sources of unfairness in FL, namely, Unique Disparity, Redundant Disparity, and Masked Disparity. We demonstrate how these three disparities contribute to global and local fairness using canonical examples. This decomposition helps us derive fundamental limits on the trade-off between global and local fairness, highlighting where they agree or disagree. We introduce the Accuracy & Global-Local Fairness Optimality Problem (AGLFOP), a convex optimization that defines the theoretical limits of accuracy and fairness trade-offs, identifying the best possible performance any FL strategy can attain given a dataset and client distribution. We also present experimental results on synthetic datasets and the ADULT dataset to support our theoretical findings.",

We propose Pathformer, a multi-scale Transformer with adaptive pathways. It integrates both temporal resolution and temporal distance for multi-scale modeling. Multi-scale division divides the time series into different temporal resolutions using patches of various sizes. Based on the division of each scale, dual attention is performed over these patches to capture global correlations and local details as temporal dependencies. We further enrich the multiscale Transformer with adaptive pathways, which adaptively adjust the multi-scale modeling process based on the varying temporal dynamics of the input, improving the accuracy and generalization of Pathformer.

        "abstract": "Characterizing samples that are difficult to learn from is crucial to developing highly performant ML models. This has led to numerous Hardness Characterization Methods (HCMs) that aim to identify \u201chard\u201d samples. However, there is a lack of consensus regarding the definition and evaluation of \u201chardness\u201d. Unfortunately, current HCMs have only been evaluated on specific types of hardness and often only qualitatively or with respect to downstream performance, overlooking the fundamental quantitative identification task. We address this gap by presenting a fine-grained taxonomy of hardness types. Additionally, we propose the Hardness Characterization Analysis Toolkit (H-CAT), which supports comprehensive and quantitative benchmarking of HCMs across the hardness taxonomy and can easily be extended to new HCMs, hardness types, and datasets. We use H-CAT to evaluate 13 different HCMs across 8 hardness types. This comprehensive evaluation encompassing over 14K setups uncovers strengths and weaknesses of different HCMs, leading to practical tips to guide HCM selection and future development. Our findings highlight the need for more comprehensive HCM evaluation, while we hope our hardness taxonomy and toolkit will advance the principled evaluation and uptake of data-centric AI methods.",

Whereas prior works have largely focused on leveraging LLMs for generating abstract plans in symbolic spaces, this work uses LLMs to guide the learning for structures and constraints in robot manipulation tasks. Specifically, we borrow from manipulation planning literature the concept of mode families, defining specific types of motion constraints among sets of objects, to serve as an intermediate layer that connects high-level language representations with low-level physical trajectories. By locally perturbing a small set of successful human demonstrations, we augment the dataset with additional successful executions as well as counterfactuals that fail the task. Our explanation-based learning framework trains neural network-based classifiers to differentiate success task executions from failures and as a by-product learns classifiers that ground low-level states into mode families without dense labeling. This further enables us to learn structured policies for the target task. Experimental validation in both 2D continuous-space and robotic manipulation environments demonstrates the robustness of our mode-based imitation methods under external perturbations.",

        "abstract": "Equilibrium propagation (EP) is a compelling alternative to the backpropagation of error algorithm (BP) for computing gradients of neural networks on biological or analog neuromorphic substrates. Still, the algorithm requires weight symmetry and infinitesimal equilibrium perturbations, i.e., nudges, to yield unbiased gradient estimates. Both requirements are challenging to implement in physical systems. Yet, whether and how weight asymmetry contributes to bias is unknown because, in practice, its contribution may be masked by a finite nudge. To address this question, we study generalized EP, which can be formulated without weight symmetry, and analytically isolate the two sources of bias. For complex-differentiable non-symmetric networks, we show that bias due to finite nudge can be avoided by estimating exact derivatives via a Cauchy integral. In contrast, weight asymmetry induces residual bias through poor alignment of EP\u2019s neuronal error vectors compared to BP resulting in low task performance. To mitigate the latter issue, we present a new homeostatic objective that directly penalizes functional asymmetries of the Jacobian at the network\u2019s fixed point. This homeostatic objective dramatically improves the network\u2019s ability to solve complex tasks such as ImageNet 32\u00d732. Our results lay the theoretical groundwork for studying and mitigating the adverse effects of imperfections of physical networks on learning algorithms that rely on the substrate\u2019s relaxation dynamics.",

        "abstract": "Maintaining legacy software requires many software and systems engineering hours. Assembly code programs, which demand low-level control over the computer machine state and have no variable names, are particularly difficult for humans to analyze. Existing conventional program translators guarantee correctness, but are hand-engineered for the source and target programming languages in question. Learned transpilation, i.e. automatic translation of code, offers an alternative to manual re-writing and engineering efforts. Automated symbolic program translation approaches guarantee correctness but struggle to scale to longer programs due to the exponentially large search space. Their rigid rule-based systems also limit their expressivity, so they can only reason about a reduced space of programs. Probabilistic neural language models (LMs) produce plausible outputs for every input, but do so at the cost of guaranteed correctness. In this work, we leverage the strengths of LMs and symbolic solvers in a neurosymbolic approach to learned transpilation for assembly code. Assembly code is an appropriate setting for a neurosymbolic approach, since assembly code can be divided into shorter non-branching basic blocks amenable to the use of symbolic methods. GUESS & SKETCH extracts alignment and confidence information from features of the LM then passes it to a symbolic solver to resolve semantic equivalence of the transpilation input and output. We test GUESS & SKETCH on three different test sets of assembly transpilation tasks, varying in difficulty, and show that it successfully transpiles 57.6% more examples than GPT-4 and 39.6% more examples than an engineered transpiler.

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) is a standard approach for fine-tuning large language models to follow instructions. As part of this process, learned reward models are used to approximately model human preferences. However, as imperfect representations of the \u201ctrue\u201d reward, these learned reward models are susceptible to overoptimization. Gao et al. (2023) studied this phenomenon in a synthetic human feedback setup with a significantly larger \u201cgold\u201d reward model acting as the true reward (instead of humans) and showed that overoptimization remains a persistent problem regardless of the size of the proxy reward model and training data used. Using a similar setup, we conduct a systematic study to evaluate the efficacy of using ensemble-based conservative optimization objectives, specifically worst-case optimization (WCO) and uncertainty-weighted optimization (UWO), for mitigating reward model overoptimization when using two optimization methods: (a) best-of-n sampling (BoN) (b) proximal policy optimization (PPO). We additionally extend the setup of Gao et al. (2023) to include 25% label noise to better mirror real-world conditions. Both with and without label noise, we find that conservative optimization practically eliminates overoptimization and improves performance by up to 70% for BoN sampling. For PPO, ensemble-based conservative optimization always reduces overoptimization and outperforms single reward model optimization. Moreover, combining it with a small KL penalty successfully prevents overoptimization at no performance cost. Overall, our results demonstrate that ensemble-based conservative optimization can effectively counter overoptimization.",

        "abstract": "While large language models (LLMs) exhibit remarkable capabilities across a wide range of tasks, they pose potential safety concerns, such as the \u201cjailbreak\u201d problem, wherein malicious instructions can manipulate LLMs to exhibit undesirable behavior. Although several preventive measures have been developed to mitigate the potential risks associated with LLMs, they have primarily focused on English. In this study, we reveal the presence of multilingual jailbreak challenges within LLMs and consider two potential risky scenarios: unintentional and intentional. The unintentional scenario involves users querying LLMs using non-English prompts and inadvertently bypassing the safety mechanisms, while the intentional scenario concerns malicious users combining malicious instructions with multilingual prompts to deliberately attack LLMs. The experimental results reveal that in the unintentional scenario, the rate of unsafe content increases as the availability of languages decreases. Specifically, low-resource languages exhibit about three times the likelihood of encountering harmful content compared to high-resource languages, with both ChatGPT and GPT-4. In the intentional scenario, multilingual prompts can exacerbate the negative impact of malicious instructions, with astonishingly high rates of unsafe output: 80.92% for ChatGPT and 40.71% for GPT-4. To handle such a challenge in the multilingual context, we propose a novel SELF-DEFENSE framework that automatically generates multilingual training data for safety fine-tuning. Experimental results show that ChatGPT fine-tuned with such data can achieve a substantial reduction in unsafe content generation.

        "abstract": "Split conformal prediction has recently sparked great interest due to its ability to provide formally guaranteed uncertainty sets or intervals for predictions made by black-box neural models, ensuring a predefined probability of containing the actual ground truth. While the original formulation assumes data exchangeability, some extensions handle non-exchangeable data, which is often the case in many real-world scenarios. In parallel, some progress has been made in conformal methods that provide statistical guarantees for a broader range of objectives, such as bounding the best F1-score or minimizing the false negative rate in expectation. In this paper, we leverage and extend these two lines of work by proposing nonexchangeable conformal risk control, which allows controlling the expected value of any monotone loss function when the data is not exchangeable. Our framework is flexible, makes very few assumptions, and allows weighting the data based on its relevance for a given test example; a careful choice of weights may result in tighter bounds, making our framework useful in the presence of change points, time series, or other forms of distribution drift. Experiments with both synthetic and real world data show the usefulness of our method.",

        "abstract": "In theoretical neuroscience, recent work leverages deep learning tools to explore how some network attributes critically influence its learning dynamics. Notably, initial weight distributions with small (resp. large) variance may yield a rich (resp. lazy) regime, where significant (resp. minor) changes to network states and representation are observed over the course of learning. However, in biology, neural circuit connectivity could exhibit a low-rank structure and therefore differs markedly from the random initializations generally used for these studies. As such, here we investigate how the structure of the initial weights \u2014 in particular their effective rank \u2014 influences the network learning regime. Through both empirical and theoretical analyses, we discover that high-rank initializations typically yield smaller network changes indicative of lazier learning, a finding we also confirm with experimentally-driven initial connectivity in recurrent neural networks. Conversely, low-rank initialization biases learning towards richer learning. Importantly, however, as an exception to this rule, we find lazier learning can still occur with a low-rank initialization that aligns with task and data statistics. Our research highlights the pivotal role of initial weight structures in shaping learning regimes, with implications for metabolic costs of plasticity and risks of catastrophic forgetting.",

        "abstract": "Alignment with human preference is a desired property of large language models (LLMs). Currently, the main alignment approach is based on reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF). Despite the effectiveness of RLHF, it is intricate to implement and train, thus recent studies explore how to develop alternative alignment approaches based on supervised fine-tuning (SFT). A major limitation of SFT is that it essentially does imitation learning, which cannot fully understand what are the expected behaviors. To address this issue, we propose an improved alignment approach named FIGA. Different from prior methods, we incorporate fine-grained (i.e., token or phrase level) quality signals that are derived by contrasting good and bad responses. Our approach has made two major contributions. Firstly, we curate a refined alignment dataset that pairs initial responses and the corresponding revised ones. Secondly, we devise a new loss function can leverage fine-grained quality signals to instruct the learning of LLMs for alignment. Extensive experiments have demonstrated the effectiveness of our approaches by comparing a number of competitive baselines.

The approach curates a high-quality alignment dataset, pairs initial responses with revised responses, and designs a new learning objective that leverages fine-grained quality signals. FIGA shows superior performance on extensive tasks, with +3.2 points and +1.8 points against the initial supervised-finetuned model and the strong PPO method.\n\nStrengths:\n1.

        "abstract": "Online-Within-Online (OWO) meta learning stands for the online multi-task learning paradigm in which both tasks and data within each task become available in a sequential order. In this work, we study the OWO meta learning of the initialization and step size of within-task online algorithms in the non-convex setting, and provide improved regret bounds under mild assumptions of loss functions. Previous work analyzing this scenario has obtained for bounded and piecewise Lipschitz functions an averaged regret bound O(( \u221a m T 1/4 + (logm) log T \u221a T + V ) \u221a m) across T tasks, with m iterations per task and V the task similarity. Our first contribution is to modify the existing non-convex OWO meta learning algorithm and improve the regret bound to O(( 1 T 1/2\u2212\u03b1 + (log T ) 9/2 T + V ) \u221a m), for any \u03b1 \u2208 (0, 1/2). The derived bound has a faster convergence rate with respect to T , and guarantees a vanishing task-averaged regret with respect to m (for any fixed T ). Then, we propose a new algorithm of regret O(( log T T + V ) \u221a m) for non-convex OWO meta learning. This regret bound exhibits a better asymptotic performance than previous ones, and holds for any bounded (not necessarily Lipschitz) loss functions. Besides the improved regret bounds, our contributions include investigating how to attain generalization bounds for statistical meta learning via regret analysis. Specifically, by online-to-batch arguments, we achieve a transfer risk bound for batch meta learning that assumes all tasks are drawn from a distribution. Moreover, by connecting multi-task generalization error with taskaveraged regret, we develop for statistical multi-task learning a novel PAC-Bayes generalization error bound that involves our regret bound for OWO meta learning.",

        "abstract": "Inverse problems aim to determine parameters from observations, a crucial task in engineering and science. Lately, generative models, especially diffusion models, have gained popularity in this area for their ability to produce realistic solutions and their good mathematical properties. Despite their success, an important drawback of diffusion models is their sensitivity to the choice of variance schedule, which controls the dynamics of the diffusion process. Fine-tuning this schedule for specific applications is crucial but time-consuming and does not guarantee an optimal result. We propose a novel approach for learning the schedule as part of the training process. Our method supports probabilistic conditioning on data, provides high-quality solutions, and is flexible, proving able to adapt to different applications with minimum overhead. This approach is tested in two unrelated inverse problems: super-resolution microscopy and quantitative phase imaging, yielding comparable or superior results to previous methods and fine-tuned diffusion models. We conclude that fine-tuning the schedule by experimentation should be avoided because it can be learned during training in a stable way that yields better results.

        "abstract": "Knowledge distillation aims to train a compact student network using soft supervision from a larger teacher network and hard supervision from ground truths. However, determining an optimal knowledge fusion ratio that balances these supervisory signals remains challenging. Prior methods generally resort to a constant or heuristic-based fusion ratio, which often falls short of a proper balance. In this study, we introduce a novel adaptive method for learning a sample-wise knowledge fusion ratio, exploiting both the correctness of teacher and student, as well as how well the student mimics the teacher on each sample. Our method naturally leads to the intra-sample trilateral geometric relations among the student prediction (S), teacher prediction (T ), and ground truth (G). To counterbalance the impact of outliers, we further extend to the inter-sample relations, incorporating the teacher\u2019s global average prediction (T\u0304 ) for samples within the same class. A simple neural network then learns the implicit mapping from the intraand inter-sample relations to an adaptive, sample-wise knowledge fusion ratio in a bilevel-optimization manner. Our approach provides a simple, practical, and adaptable solution for knowledge distillation that can be employed across various architectures and model sizes. Extensive experiments demonstrate consistent improvements over other loss re-weighting methods on image classification, attack detection, and click-through rate prediction.",

        "abstract": "Previous literature on policy diversity in reinforcement learning (RL) either focuses on the online setting or ignores the policy performance. In contrast, offline RL, which aims to learn high-quality policies from batched data, has yet to fully leverage the intrinsic diversity of the offline dataset. Addressing this dichotomy and aiming to balance quality and diversity poses a significant challenge to extant methodologies. This paper introduces a novel approach, termed Stylized Offline RL (SORL), which is designed to extract high-performing, stylistically diverse policies from a dataset characterized by distinct behavioral patterns. Drawing inspiration from the venerable Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm, SORL innovatively alternates between policy learning and trajectory clustering, a mechanism that promotes policy diversification. To further augment policy performance, we introduce advantage-weighted style learning into the SORL framework.

This method constructs a smoothed DNN model and certifies its robustness through statistical sampling, but it is computationally expensive, especially when certifying with a large number of samples. Furthermore, when the smoothed model is modified (e.g., quantized or pruned), certification guarantees may not hold for the modified DNN, and recertifying from scratch can be prohibitively expensive. We present the first approach for incremental robustness certification for randomized smoothing, IRS. We show how to reuse the certification guarantees for the original smoothed model to certify an approximated model with very few samples. IRS significantly reduces the computational cost of certifying modified DNNs while maintaining strong robustness guarantees.

        "abstract": "The fluency and creativity of large pre-trained language models (LLMs) have led to their widespread use, sometimes even as a replacement for traditional search engines. Yet language models are prone to making convincing but factually inaccurate claims, often referred to as \u2018hallucinations.\u2019 These errors can inadvertently spread misinformation or harmfully perpetuate misconceptions. Further, manual fact-checking of model responses is a time-consuming process, making human factuality labels expensive to acquire. In this work, we fine-tune language models to be more factual, without human labeling and targeting more open-ended generation settings than past work. We leverage two key recent innovations in NLP to do so. First, several recent works have proposed methods for judging the factuality of open-ended text by measuring consistency with an external knowledge base or simply a large model\u2019s confidence scores. Second, the direct preference optimization algorithm enables straightforward fine-tuning of language models on objectives other than supervised imitation, using a preference ranking over possible model responses. We show that learning from automatically generated factuality preference rankings, generated either through existing retrieval systems or our novel retrieval-free approach, significantly improves the factuality (percent of generated claims that are correct) of Llama-2 on held-out topics compared with RLHF or decoding strategies targeted at factuality. At 7B scale, compared to Llama-2-chat, we observe 58% and 40% reduction in factual error rate when generating biographies and answering medical questions, respectively.",

The authors introduce two approaches to estimating truthfulness in long-form text: a reference-based approach using FactScore and a reference-free approach using the language model's own confidence. The authors then optimize for these criteria using preference-based learning. The experiments show that fine-tuning with either criterion reliably reduces the number of incorrect facts generated by the model, and the reference-free approach provides a scalable self-supervision strategy to improve factuality without the need for a reference corpus of 'gold' texts.\n\nStrengths:\n1.

The standard approach to data augmentation combines simple transformations like rotations and flips to generate new images from existing ones.

Current augmentations cannot alter the high-level semantic attributes, such as animal species present in a scene, to enhance the diversity of data.

Focusing on image classification, we consider the setting of a black-box transfer attack where an attacker does not know the target model. Instead of forcing corrupted image representations to cross the nearest decision boundaries or converge to a particular point, we propose a distribution-oriented approach. We rely on optimal transport to push the feature distribution of attacked images towards an already modeled distribution. We show that this new distribution-oriented approach leads to better transferable patches.

To help researchers study this problem, we present a dataset of over 126,000 prompt injection attacks and 46,000 prompt-based \u201cdefenses\u201d against prompt injection, all created by players of an online game called Tensor Trust. To the best of our knowledge, this is currently the largest dataset of human-generated adversarial examples for instruction-following LLMs. The attacks in our dataset have easily interpretable structure, and shed light on the weaknesses of LLMs. We also use the dataset to create a benchmark for resistance to two types of prompt injection, which we refer to as prompt extraction and prompt hijacking. Our benchmark results show that many models are vulnerable to the attack strategies in the Tensor Trust dataset. Furthermore, we show that some attack strategies from the dataset generalize to deployed LLM-based applications, even though they have a very different set of constraints to the game.

        "abstract": "There is increasing interest in methods for extracting interpretable rules from ML models trained to solve a wide range of tasks over knowledge graphs (KGs), such as KG completion, node classification, question answering and recommendation. Many such approaches, however, lack formal guarantees establishing the precise relationship between the model and the extracted rules, and this lack of assurance becomes especially problematic when the extracted rules are applied in safetycritical contexts or to ensure compliance with legal requirements. Recent research has examined whether the rules derived from the influential NEURAL-LP model exhibit soundness (or completeness), which means that the results obtained by applying the model to any dataset always contain (or are contained in) the results obtained by applying the rules to the same dataset. In this paper, we extend this analysis to the context of DRUM, an approach that has demonstrated superior practical performance. After observing that the rules currently extracted from a DRUM model can be unsound and/or incomplete, we propose a novel algorithm where the output rules, expressed in an extension of Datalog, ensure both soundness and completeness. This algorithm, however, can be inefficient in practice and hence we propose additional constraints to DRUM models facilitating rule extraction, albeit at the expense of reduced expressive power.",

        "abstract": "Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) stands as a cornerstone optimization algorithm with proven real-world empirical successes but relatively limited theoretical understanding. Recent research has illuminated a key factor contributing to its practical efficacy: the implicit regularization it instigates. Several studies have investigated the linear stability property of SGD in the vicinity of a stationary point as a predictive proxy for sharpness and generalization error in overparameterized neural networks (Wu et al., 2022; Jastrzebski et al., 2019; Cohen et al., 2021). In this paper, we delve deeper into the relationship between linear stability and sharpness. More specifically, we meticulously delineate the necessary and sufficient conditions for linear stability, contingent on hyperparameters of SGD and the sharpness at the optimum. Towards this end, we introduce a novel coherence measure of the loss Hessian that encapsulates pertinent geometric properties of the loss function that are relevant to the linear stability of SGD. It enables us to provide a simplified sufficient condition for identifying linear instability at an optimum. Notably, compared to previous works, our analysis relies on significantly milder assumptions and is applicable for a broader class of loss functions than known before, encompassing not only mean-squared error but also cross-entropy loss.",

        "abstract": "Supervised learning methods have been found to exhibit inductive biases favoring simpler features. When such features are spuriously correlated with the label, this can result in suboptimal performance on minority subgroups. Despite the growing popularity of methods which learn from unlabeled data, the extent to which these representations rely on spurious features for prediction is unclear. In this work, we explore the impact of spurious features on Self-Supervised Learning (SSL) for visual representation learning. We first empirically show that commonly used augmentations in SSL can cause undesired invariances in the image space, and illustrate this with a simple example. We further show that classical approaches in combating spurious correlations, such as dataset re-sampling during SSL, do not consistently lead to invariant representations. Motivated by these findings, we propose LATETVG to remove spurious information from these representations during pretraining, by regularizing later layers of the encoder via pruning. We find that our method produces representations which outperform the baselines on several benchmarks, without the need for group or label information during SSL.",

However, existing benchmarks for constrained generation usually focus on fixed constraint types (e.g. generate a sentence containing certain words) that have proved to be easy for state-of-the-art models like GPT-4. We present COLLIE, a grammar-based framework that allows the specification of rich, compositional constraints with diverse generation levels (word, sentence, paragraph, passage) and modeling challenges (e.g. language understanding, logical reasoning, counting, semantic planning). We also develop tools for automatic extraction of task instances given a constraint structure and a raw text corpus. Using COLLIE, we compile the COLLIE-v1 dataset with 2,080 instances comprising 13 constraint structures. We perform systematic experiments across five state-of-the-art instruction-tuned language models and analyze their performances to reveal shortcomings. COLLIE is designed to be extensible and lightweight, and we hope the community finds it useful to develop more complex constraints and evaluations in the future.",

Within this framework, the doubly robust (DR) estimator was derived and has shown its effectiveness in estimation, especially when the model assumption is violated. However, the current form of the DR estimator is restricted to binary treatments, while the treatments can be continuous in many real-world applications. The primary obstacle to continuous treatments resides in the delta function present in the original DR estimator, making it infeasible in causal effect estimation and introducing a heavy computational burden in nuisance function estimation. To address these challenges, we propose a kernel-based DR estimator that can well handle continuous treatments for proximal causal learning. Equipped with its smoothness, we show that its oracle form is a consistent approximation of the influence function. Further, we propose a new approach to efficiently solve the nuisance functions. We then provide a comprehensive convergence analysis in terms of the mean square error. We demonstrate the utility of our estimator on synthetic datasets and real-world applications1.",

        "abstract": "Mixture models arise in many regression problems, but most methods have seen limited adoption partly due to these algorithms\u2019 highly-tailored and model-specific nature. On the other hand, transformers are flexible, neural sequence models that present the intriguing possibility of providing general-purpose prediction methods, even in this mixture setting. In this work, we investigate the hypothesis that transformers can learn an optimal predictor for mixtures of regressions. We construct a generative process for a mixture of linear regressions for which the decision-theoretic optimal procedure is given by data-driven exponential weights on a finite set of parameters. We observe that transformers achieve low meansquared error on data generated via this process. By probing the transformer\u2019s output at inference time, we also show that transformers typically make predictions that are close to the optimal predictor. Our experiments also demonstrate that transformers can learn mixtures of regressions in a sample-efficient fashion and are somewhat robust to distribution shifts. We complement our experimental observations by proving constructively that the decision-theoretic optimal procedure is indeed implementable by a transformer.",

        "title": "ADAMERGING: ADAPTIVE MODEL MERGING FOR MULTI-TASK LEARNING",
        "abstract": "Multi-task learning (MTL) aims to empower a model to tackle multiple tasks simultaneously. A recent development known as task arithmetic has revealed that several models, each fine-tuned for distinct tasks, can be directly merged into a single model to execute MTL without necessitating a retraining process using the initial training data. Nevertheless, this direct addition of models often leads to a significant deterioration in the overall performance of the merged model. This decline occurs due to potential conflicts and intricate correlations among the multiple tasks. Consequently, the challenge emerges of how to merge pre-trained models more effectively without using their original training data. This paper introduces an innovative technique called Adaptive Model Merging (AdaMerging). This approach aims to autonomously learn the coefficients for model merging, either in a task-wise or layer-wise manner, without relying on the original training data. Specifically, our AdaMerging method operates as an automatic, unsupervised task arithmetic scheme. It leverages entropy minimization on unlabeled test samples from the multi-task setup as a surrogate objective function to iteratively refine the merging coefficients of the multiple models. Our experimental findings across eight tasks demonstrate the efficacy of the AdaMerging scheme we put forth. Compared to the current state-of-the-art task arithmetic merging scheme, AdaMerging showcases a remarkable 11% improvement in performance. Notably, AdaMerging also exhibits superior generalization capabilities when applied to unseen downstream tasks. Furthermore, it displays a significantly enhanced robustness to data distribution shifts that may occur during the testing phase. The code is available at AdaMerging.",

Modeling the combinatorially large space of sequences is infeasible; prior methods often constrain optimization to a small mutational radius, but this drastically limits the design space. Instead of heuristics, we propose smoothing the fitness landscape to facilitate protein optimization. First, we formulate protein fitness as a graph signal then use Tikunov regularization to smooth the fitness landscape. We find optimizing in this smoothed landscape leads to improved performance across multiple methods in the GFP and AAV benchmarks. Second, we achieve state-of-the-art results utilizing discrete energy-based models and MCMC in the smoothed landscape. Our method, called Gibbs sampling with Graph-based Smoothing (GGS), demonstrates a unique ability to achieve 2.5 fold fitness improvement (with in-silico evaluation) over its training set.

        "abstract": "Privacy amplification exploits randomness in data selection to provide tighter differential privacy (DP) guarantees. This analysis is key to DP-SGD\u2019s success in machine learning (ML), but, is not readily applicable to the newer state-of-the-art (SOTA) algorithms. This is because these algorithms, known as DP-FTRL, use the matrix mechanism to add correlated noise instead of independent noise as in DP-SGD. In this paper, we propose \u201cMMCC\u201d, the first algorithm to analyze privacy amplification via sampling for any generic matrix mechanism. MMCC is nearly tight in that it approaches a lower bound as \u03b5\u2192 0. To analyze correlated outputs in MMCC, we prove that they can be analyzed as if they were independent, by conditioning them on prior outputs. Our \u201cconditional composition theorem\u201d has broad utility: we use it to show that the noise added to binary-tree-DP-FTRL can asymptotically match the noise added to DP-SGD with amplification. Our algorithm also has practical empirical utility. We show that amplification leads to significant improvement in the privacy/utility trade-offs for DP-FTRL style algorithms for standard benchmark tasks.",

        "abstract": "Proactive dialogues serve as a practical yet challenging dialogue problem in the era of large language models (LLMs), where the dialogue policy planning is the key to improving the proactivity of LLMs. Most existing studies enable the dialogue policy planning of LLMs using various prompting schemes or iteratively enhance this capability in handling the given case with verbal AI feedback. However, these approaches are either bounded by the policy planning capability of the frozen LLMs or hard to be transferred to new cases. In this work, we introduce a new dialogue policy planning paradigm to strategize LLMs for proactive dialogue problems with a tunable language model plug-in as a plug-and-play dialogue policy planner, named PPDPP. Specifically, we develop a novel training framework to facilitate supervised fine-tuning over available human-annotated data as well as reinforcement learning from goal-oriented AI feedback with dynamic interaction data collected by the LLM-based self-play simulation. In this manner, the LLM-powered dialogue agent can not only be generalized to different cases after the training, but also be applicable to different applications by just substituting the learned plug-in. In addition, we propose to evaluate the policy planning capability of dialogue systems under the interactive setting. Experimental results demonstrate that PPDPP consistently and substantially outperforms existing approaches on three different proactive dialogue applications, including negotiation, emotional support, and tutoring dialogues.1",

        "abstract": "Assigning importance weights to adversarial data has achieved great success in training adversarially robust networks under limited model capacity. However, existing instance-reweighted adversarial training (AT) methods heavily depend on heuristics and/or geometric interpretations to determine those importance weights, making these algorithms lack rigorous theoretical justification/guarantee. Moreover, recent research has shown that adversarial training suffers from a severe non-uniform robust performance across the training distribution, e.g., data points belonging to some classes can be much more vulnerable to adversarial attacks than others. To address both issues, in this paper, we propose a novel doubly-robust instance reweighted AT framework, which allows to obtain the importance weights via exploring distributionally robust optimization (DRO) techniques, and at the same time boosts the robustness on the most vulnerable examples. In particular, our importance weights are obtained by optimizing the KL-divergence regularized loss function, which allows us to devise new algorithms with a theoretical convergence guarantee. Experiments on standard classification datasets demonstrate that our proposed approach outperforms related state-of-the-art baseline methods in terms of average robust performance, and at the same time improves the robustness against attacks on the weakest data points.

Specifically, we focus on agents that perform tasks on the web, and create an environment with fully functional websites from four common domains: e-commerce, social forum discussions, collaborative software development, and content management. Our environment is enriched with tools (e.g., a map) and external knowledge bases (e.g., user manuals) to encourage human-like task-solving. Building upon our environment, we release a set of benchmark tasks focusing on evaluating the functional correctness of task completions. The tasks in our benchmark are diverse, long-horizon, and designed to emulate tasks that humans routinely perform on the internet. We experiment with several baseline agents, integrating recent techniques such as reasoning before acting. The results demonstrate that solving complex tasks is challenging: our best GPT-4-based agent only achieves an end-to-end task success rate of 14.41%, significantly lower than the human performance of 78.24%.

Gradient descent assumes that the distance is Euclidean, but many other distances are possible, and there is no reason that biology necessarily uses Euclidean geometry. Here, using the theoretical tools provided by mirror descent, we show that the distribution of synaptic weights will depend on the geometry of synaptic plasticity. We use these results to show that experimentally-observed log-normal weight distributions found in several brain areas are not consistent with standard gradient descent (i.e. a Euclidean geometry), but rather with nonEuclidean distances. Finally, we show that it should be possible to experimentally test for different synaptic geometries by comparing synaptic weight distributions before and after learning.

Existing methods typically involve either rasterizing the vector graphics into images and using image-based methods for symbol spotting, or directly building graphs and using graph neural networks for symbol recognition. In this paper, we take a different approach, which treats graphic primitives as a set of 2D points that are locally connected and use point cloud segmentation methods to tackle it. Specifically, we utilize a point transformer to extract the primitive features and append a mask2former-like spotting head to predict the final output. To better use the local connection information of primitives and enhance their discriminability, we further propose the attention with connection module (ACM) and contrastive connection learning scheme (CCL). Finally, we propose a KNN interpolation mechanism for the mask attention module of the spotting head to better handle primitive mask downsampling, which is primitive-level in contrast to pixel-level for the image. Our approach, named SymPoint, is simple yet effective, outperforming recent state-of-the-art method GAT-CADNet by an absolute increase of 9.6% PQ and 10.4% RQ on the FloorPlanCAD dataset.

        "abstract": "Recently, it has been shown that for offline deep reinforcement learning (DRL), pre-training Decision Transformer with a large language corpus can improve downstream performance (Reid et al., 2022). A natural question to ask is whether this performance gain can only be achieved with language pre-training, or can be achieved with simpler pre-training schemes which do not involve language. In this paper, we first show that language is not essential for improved performance, and indeed pre-training with synthetic IID data for a small number of updates can match the performance gains from pre-training with a large language corpus; moreover, pre-training with data generated by a one-step Markov chain can further improve the performance. Inspired by these experimental results, we then consider pre-training Conservative Q-Learning (CQL), a popular offline DRL algorithm, which is Q-learning-based and typically employs a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) backbone. Surprisingly, pre-training with simple synthetic data for a small number of updates can also improve CQL, providing consistent performance improvement on D4RL Gym locomotion datasets. The results of this paper not only illustrate the importance of pre-training for offline DRL but also show that the pre-training data can be synthetic and generated with remarkably simple mechanisms.",

With the recent development of diffusion models, data attribution has become a desired module to properly assign valuations for high-quality or copyrighted training samples, ensuring that data contributors are fairly compensated or credited. Several theoretically motivated methods have been proposed to implement data attribution, in an effort to improve the trade-off between computational scalability and effectiveness. In this work, we conduct extensive experiments and ablation studies on attributing diffusion models, specifically focusing on DDPMs trained on CIFAR-10 and CelebA, as well as a Stable Diffusion model LoRA-finetuned on ArtBench. Intriguingly, we report counter-intuitive observations that theoretically unjustified design choices for attribution empirically outperform previous baselines by a large margin, in terms of both linear datamodeling score and counterfactual evaluation. Our work presents a significantly more efficient approach for attributing diffusion models, while the unexpected findings suggest that at least in non-convex settings, constructions guided by theoretical assumptions may lead to inferior attribution performance.

This provides a mechanism to automatically reject solutions whose formalized versions are inconsistent within themselves or with the formalized problem statement. We evaluate our method on GSM8K, MATH and MultiArith datasets and demonstrate that our approach provides a consistently better heuristic than vanilla majority voting \u2014 the previously best method to identify correct answers, by more than 12% on GSM8K.

        "title": "TEXT-TO-3D WITH CLASSIFIER SCORE DISTILLATION",
        "abstract": "Text-to-3D generation has made remarkable progress recently, particularly with methods based on Score Distillation Sampling (SDS) that leverages pre-trained 2D diffusion models. While the usage of classifier-free guidance is well acknowledged to be crucial for successful optimization, it is considered an auxiliary trick rather than the most essential component. In this paper, we re-evaluate the role of classifier-free guidance in score distillation and discover a surprising finding: the guidance alone is enough for effective text-to-3D generation tasks. We name this method Classifier Score Distillation (CSD), which can be interpreted as using an implicit classification model for generation. This new perspective reveals new insights for understanding existing techniques. We validate the effectiveness of CSD across a variety of text-to-3D tasks including shape generation, texture synthesis, and shape editing, achieving results superior to those of state-of-the-art methods.

Our algorithm draws inspiration from the recent work of Chen et al., who developed DP algorithms for recovery of stochastic block models in cases where the graph comprises exactly two nearly-balanced clusters. Our algorithm works for well-clustered graphs with k nearly-balanced clusters, and the misclassification ratio almost matches the one of the best-known non-private algorithms.

        "abstract": "Deep graph clustering has recently received significant attention due to its ability to enhance the representation learning capabilities of models in unsupervised scenarios. Nevertheless, deep clustering for temporal graphs, which could capture crucial dynamic interaction information, has not been fully explored. It means that in many clustering-oriented real-world scenarios, temporal graphs can only be processed as static graphs. This not only causes the loss of dynamic information but also triggers huge computational consumption. To solve the problem, we propose a general framework for deep Temporal Graph Clustering called TGC, which introduces deep clustering techniques to suit the interaction sequence-based batch-processing pattern of temporal graphs. In addition, we discuss differences between temporal graph clustering and static graph clustering from several levels. To verify the superiority of the proposed framework TGC, we conduct extensive experiments.

        "abstract": "Audio-visual speech separation methods aim to integrate different modalities to generate high-quality separated speech, thereby enhancing the performance of downstream tasks such as speech recognition. Most existing state-of-the-art (SOTA) models operate in the time domain. However, their overly simplistic approach to modeling acoustic features often necessitates larger and more computationally intensive models in order to achieve SOTA performance. In this paper, we present a novel time-frequency domain audio-visual speech separation method: Recurrent Time-Frequency Separation Network (RTFS-Net), which applies its algorithms on the complex time-frequency bins yielded by the Short-Time Fourier Transform. We model and capture the time and frequency dimensions of the audio independently using a multi-layered RNN along each dimension. Furthermore, we introduce a unique attention-based fusion technique for the efficient integration of audio and visual information, and a new mask separation approach that takes advantage of the intrinsic spectral nature of the acoustic features for a clearer separation. RTFS-Net outperforms the prior SOTA method in both inference speed and separation quality while reducing the number of parameters by 90% and MACs by 83%.

        "title": "CROSS-MODAL CONTEXTUALIZED DIFFUSION MOD-",
        "abstract": "Conditional diffusion models have exhibited superior performance in high-fidelity text-guided visual generation and editing. Nevertheless, prevailing text-guided visual diffusion models primarily focus on incorporating text-visual relationships exclusively into the reverse process, often disregarding their relevance in the forward process. This inconsistency between forward and reverse processes may limit the precise conveyance of textual semantics in visual synthesis results. To address this issue, we propose a novel and general contextualized diffusion model (CONTEXTDIFF) by incorporating the cross-modal context encompassing interactions and alignments between text condition and visual sample into forward and reverse processes. We propagate this context to all timesteps in the two processes to adapt their trajectories, thereby facilitating cross-modal conditional modeling. We generalize our contextualized diffusion to both DDPMs and DDIMs with theoretical derivations, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our model in evaluations with two challenging tasks: text-to-image generation, and text-to-video editing. In each task, our CONTEXTDIFF achieves new state-of-the-art performance, significantly enhancing the semantic alignment between text condition and generated samples, as evidenced by quantitative and qualitative evaluations.

        "abstract": "Recent empirical evidence indicates that transformer based in-context learning performs better when using a prefix language model (prefixLM), in which incontext samples can all attend to each other, compared to causal language models (causalLM), which use auto-regressive attention that prohibits in-context samples to attend to future samples. While this result is intuitive, it is not understood from a theoretical perspective. In this paper we take a theoretical approach and analyze the convergence behavior of prefixLM and causalLM under a certain parameter construction. Our analysis shows that both LM types converge to their stationary points at a linear rate, but that while prefixLM converges to the optimal solution of linear regression, causalLM convergence dynamics follows that of an online gradient descent algorithm, which is not guaranteed to be optimal even as the number of samples grows infinitely. We supplement our theoretical claims with empirical experiments over synthetic and real tasks and using various types of transformers. Our experiments verify that causalLM consistently underperforms prefixLM in all settings.",

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "$$$ Paper Summary: \nThe paper presents the LASER (LAYER-SElective Rank reduction) phenomenon, which demonstrates that carefully pruning higher-order components from specific layer types in the Transformer model can improve its performance on question-answering tasks and other modalities. The LASER intervention is a simple, non-parametric, and data-free method that requires no additional training or data. The results show that LASER can boost predictive performance by up to 27.4 percentage points on question-answering tasks and across various modalities, including reinforcement learning and computer vision. The analysis reveals that the improvements are concentrated on information less frequently present in the model's training dataset, suggesting that LASER offers a kind of denoising procedure that makes weakly learned facts accessible. \n\nThe paper also investigates the effect of LASER on language modeling and fluency, finding that the model's perplexity increases slightly, but this can be fixed by calibrating the temperature of the model. The results are evaluated on various question-answering datasets, including CounterFact, HotPotQA, Fever, and Bias in Bios, as well as on image classification tasks using a vision Transformer model. The analysis suggests that LASER jointly makes the model more robust to paraphrases of the questions and that the higher-ordered components encode either high-frequency words or alternate answers of the same semantic type as the correct answer.\n\nThe paper highlights an interesting phenomenon, where deleting information in a model helps rather than hinders the performance, and requires further study to understand the underlying mechanism and generalizability of the LASER phenomenon. \n\nStrengths: \n1. The paper presents a novel and interesting phenomenon, LASER, which demonstrates the potential benefits of carefully pruning higher-order components from specific layer types in the Transformer model.\n2.

However, interacting with recent LMMs reveals major limitations that are hardly captured by the current evaluation benchmarks. Indeed, task performances (e.g., VQA accuracy) alone do not provide enough clues to understand their real capabilities, limitations, and to which extent such models are aligned to human expectations. To refine our understanding of those flaws, we deviate from the current evaluation paradigm, and (1) evaluate 10 recent open-source LMMs from 3B up to 80B parameter scale, on 5 different axes; hallucinations, abstention, compositionality, explainability and instruction following. Our evaluation on these axes reveals major flaws in LMMs. While the current go-to solution to align these models is based on training, such as instruction tuning or RLHF, we rather (2) explore the training-free in-context learning (ICL) as a solution, and study how it affects these limitations. Based on our ICL study, (3) we push ICL further and propose new multimodal ICL variants such as; Multitask-ICL, Chain-of-Hindsight-ICL, and Self-Correcting-ICL. Our findings are as follows; (1) Despite their success, LMMs have flaws that remain unsolved with scaling alone. (2) The effect of ICL on LMMs flaws is nuanced; despite its effectiveness for improved explainability, answer abstention, ICL only slightly improves instruction following, does not improve compositional abilities, and actually even amplifies hallucinations.

        "abstract": "This work aims at decreasing the end-to-end generation latency of large language models (LLMs). One of the major causes of the high generation latency is the sequential decoding approach adopted by almost all state-of-the-art LLMs. In this work, motivated by the thinking and writing process of humans, we propose Skeleton-of-Thought (SoT), which first guides LLMs to generate the skeleton of the answer, and then conducts parallel API calls or batched decoding to complete the contents of each skeleton point in parallel. Not only does SoT provide considerable speed-ups across 12 LLMs, but it can also potentially improve the answer quality on several question categories. SoT is an initial attempt at data-centric optimization for inference efficiency, and showcases the potential of eliciting highquality answers by explicitly planning the answer structure in language.",

        "abstract": "Collecting large amounts of real-world interaction data to train general robotic policies is often prohibitively expensive, thus motivating the use of simulation data. However, existing methods for data generation have generally focused on scenelevel diversity (e.g., object instances and poses) rather than task-level diversity, due to the human effort required to come up with and verify novel tasks. This has made it challenging for policies trained on simulation data to demonstrate significant task-level generalization. In this paper, we propose to automatically generate rich simulation environments and expert demonstrations by exploiting a large language models\u2019 (LLM) grounding and coding ability. Our approach, dubbed GENSIM, has two modes: goal-directed generation, wherein a target task is given to the LLM and the LLM proposes a task curriculum to solve the target task, and exploratory generation, wherein the LLM bootstraps from previous tasks and iteratively proposes novel tasks that would be helpful in solving more complex tasks. We use GPT4 to expand the existing benchmark by ten times to over 100 tasks, on which we conduct supervised finetuning and evaluate several LLMs including finetuned GPTs and Code Llama on code generation for robotic simulation tasks. Furthermore, we observe that LLMs-generated simulation programs can enhance task-level generalization significantly when used for multitask policy training. We further find that with minimal sim-to-real adaptation, the multitask policies pretrained on GPT4-generated simulation tasks exhibit stronger transfer to unseen long-horizon tasks in the real world and outperform baselines by 25%. 1",

        "abstract": "Modeling long-range dependencies across sequences is a longstanding goal in machine learning and has led to architectures, such as state space models, that dramatically outperform Transformers on long sequences. However, these impressive empirical gains have been by and large demonstrated on benchmarks (e.g. Long Range Arena), where models are randomly initialized and trained to predict a target label from an input sequence. In this work, we show that random initialization leads to gross overestimation of the differences between architectures and that pretraining with standard denoising objectives, using only the downstream task data, leads to dramatic gains across multiple architectures and to very small gaps between Transformers and state space models (SSMs). In stark contrast to prior works, we find vanilla Transformers to match the performance of S4 on Long Range Arena when properly pretrained, and we improve the best reported results of SSMs on the PathX-256 task by 20 absolute points. Subsequently, we analyze the utility of previously-proposed structured parameterizations for SSMs and show they become mostly redundant in the presence of data-driven initialization obtained through pretraining. Our work shows that, when evaluating different architectures on supervised tasks, incorporation of data-driven priors via pretraining is essential for reliable performance estimation, and can be done efficiently.",

        "abstract": "Learning expressive stochastic policies instead of deterministic ones has been proposed to achieve better stability, sample complexity, and robustness. Notably, in Maximum Entropy Reinforcement Learning (MaxEnt RL), the policy is modeled as an expressive Energy-Based Model (EBM) over the Q-values. However, this formulation requires the estimation of the entropy of such EBMs, which is an open problem. To address this, previous MaxEnt RL methods either implicitly estimate the entropy, resulting in high computational complexity and variance (SQL), or follow a variational inference procedure that fits simplified actor distributions (e.g., Gaussian) for tractability (SAC). We propose Stein Soft Actor-Critic (S2AC), a MaxEnt RL algorithm that learns expressive policies without compromising efficiency. Specifically, S2AC uses parameterized Stein Variational Gradient Descent (SVGD) as the underlying policy. We derive a closed-form expression of the entropy of such policies. Our formula is computationally efficient and only depends on first-order derivatives and vector products. Empirical results show that S2AC yields more optimal solutions to the MaxEnt objective than SQL and SAC in the multi-goal environment, and outperforms SAC and SQL on the MuJoCo benchmark.

However, existing methods can hardly discover diverse level patterns, while the lack of diversity makes the gameplay boring. This paper proposes an ensemble reinforcement learning approach that uses multiple negatively correlated sub-policies to generate different alternative level segments, and stochastically selects one of them following a dynamic selector policy. A novel policy regularisation technique is integrated into the approach to diversify the generated alternatives. In addition, we develop theorems to provide general methodologies for optimising policy regularisation in a Markov decision process. The proposed approach is compared with several state-of-the-art policy ensemble methods and classic methods on a well-known level generation benchmark, with two different reward functions expressing game-design goals from different perspectives.

        "abstract": "Binary Neural networks (BNN) have emerged as an attractive computing paradigm for a wide range of low-power vision tasks. However, state-of-theart (SOTA) BNNs do not yield any sparsity, and induce a significant number of non-binary operations. On the other hand, activation sparsity can be provided by spiking neural networks (SNN), that too have gained significant traction in recent times. Thanks to this sparsity, SNNs when implemented on neuromorphic hardware, have the potential to be significantly more power-efficient compared to traditional artifical neural networks (ANN). However, SNNs incur multiple time steps to achieve close to SOTA accuracy. Ironically, this increases latency and energy\u2014costs that SNNs were proposed to reduce\u2014and presents itself as a major hurdle in realizing SNNs\u2019 theoretical gains in practice. This raises an intriguing question: Can we obtain SNN-like sparsity and BNN-like accuracy and enjoy the energy-efficiency benefits of both? To answer this question, in this paper, we present a training framework for sparse binary activation neural networks (BANN) using a novel variant of the Hoyer regularizer. We estimate the threshold of each BANN layer as the Hoyer extremum of a clipped version of its activation map, where the clipping value is trained using gradient descent with our Hoyer regularizer. This approach shifts the activation values away from the threshold, thereby mitigating the effect of noise that can otherwise degrade the BANN accuracy. Our approach outperforms existing BNNs, SNNs, and adder neural networks (that also avoid energy-expensive multiplication operations similar to BNNs and SNNs) in terms of the accuracy-FLOPs trade-off for complex image recognition tasks. Downstream experiments on object detection further demonstrate the efficacy of our approach. Lastly, we demonstrate the portability of our approach to SNNs with multiple time steps.

The proposed framework uses a novel variant of the Hoyer regularizer to optimize the distribution of the BANN pre-activations and a Hoyer threshold layer to set the activation threshold based on the Hoyer extremum. The results show that the proposed framework can achieve state-of-the-art accuracy-FLOPs trade-off for complex image recognition tasks and surpasses the test accuracy of existing SNN, unipolar BNN, and AddNN models with similar or better energy-efficiency. The training framework can also improve the accuracy of a number of advanced bi-polar BNNs. The proposed approach can be extended to SNNs with multiple time steps, and the sparse activation in BANNs bears resemblance to SNNs while the difference is that there is no temporal dimension. The 1-bit sparse activation in BANNs bears resemblance to BNNs, in particular uni-polar BNNs, while the difference is that the weight precision is multi-bit. Thus, BANNs can bridge the gap between BNNs and SNNs by bringing the activation sparsity of SNNs to BNNs, and removing the temporal dimension of SNNs for equivalence with BNNs.

        "abstract": "Generative Large Language Models (LLMs) have achieved remarkable advancements in various NLP tasks. However, these advances have not been reflected in the translation task, especially those with moderate model sizes (i.e., 7B or 13B parameters), which still lag behind conventional supervised encoder-decoder translation models. Previous studies have attempted to improve the translation capabilities of these LLMs, but their gains have been limited. In this study, we propose a novel fine-tuning approach for LLMs that is specifically designed for the translation task, eliminating the need for the abundant parallel data that traditional translation models usually depend on. Our approach consists of two finetuning stages: initial fine-tuning on monolingual data followed by subsequent fine-tuning on a small set of high-quality parallel data. We introduce the LLM developed through this strategy as Advanced Language Model-based trAnslator (ALMA). Based on LLaMA-2 (Touvron et al., 2023b) as our underlying model, our results show that the model can achieve an average improvement of more than 12 BLEU and 12 COMET over its zero-shot performance across 10 translation directions from the WMT\u201921 (2 directions) and WMT\u201922 (8 directions) test datasets. The performance is significantly better than all prior work and even superior to the NLLB-54B model (NLLB TEAM et al., 2022) and GPT3.5-text-davinci-003, with only 7B or 13B parameters. This method establishes the foundation for a novel training paradigm in machine translation. 1",

        "abstract": "Human motion driven control (HMDC) is an effective approach for generating natural and compelling robot motions while preserving high-level semantics. However, establishing the correspondence between humans and robots with different body structures is not straightforward due to the mismatches in kinematics and dynamics properties, which causes intrinsic ambiguity to the problem. Many previous algorithms approach this motion retargeting problem with unsupervised learning, which requires the prerequisite skill sets. However, it will be extremely costly to learn all the skills without understanding the given human motions, particularly for high-dimensional robots. In this work, we introduce CrossLoco, a guided unsupervised reinforcement learning framework that simultaneously learns robot skills and their correspondence to human motions. Our key innovation is to introduce a cycle-consistency-based reward term designed to maximize the mutual information between human motions and robot states. We demonstrate that the proposed framework can generate compelling robot motions by translating diverse human motions, such as running, hopping, and dancing. We quantitatively compare our CrossLoco against the manually engineered and unsupervised baseline algorithms along with the ablated versions of our framework and demonstrate that our method translates human motions with better accuracy, diversity, and user preference. We also showcase its utility in other applications, such as synthesizing robot movements from language input and enabling interactive robot control.",

However, the nature of the learned relationships is opaque making it difficult to understand precisely what relationships between words and parts of an image are captured, or to predict the effect of an intervention. We illuminate the fine-grained relationships learned by diffusion models by noticing a precise relationship between diffusion and information decomposition. Exact expressions for mutual information and conditional mutual information can be written in terms of the denoising model. Furthermore, pointwise estimates can be easily estimated as well, allowing us to ask questions about the relationships between specific images and captions. Decomposing information even further to understand which variables in a high-dimensional space carry information is a long-standing problem. For diffusion models, we show that a natural non-negative decomposition of mutual information emerges, allowing us to quantify informative relationships between words and pixels in an image.

        "title": "METRA: SCALABLE UNSUPERVISED RL WITH METRIC-AWARE ABSTRACTION",
        "abstract": "Unsupervised pre-training strategies have proven to be highly effective in natural language processing and computer vision. Likewise, unsupervised reinforcement learning (RL) holds the promise of discovering a variety of potentially useful behaviors that can accelerate the learning of a wide array of downstream tasks. Previous unsupervised RL approaches have mainly focused on pure exploration and mutual information skill learning. However, despite the previous attempts, making unsupervised RL truly scalable still remains a major open challenge: pure exploration approaches might struggle in complex environments with large state spaces, where covering every possible transition is infeasible, and mutual information skill learning approaches might completely fail to explore the environment due to the lack of incentives. To make unsupervised RL scalable to complex, high-dimensional environments, we propose a novel unsupervised RL objective, which we call Metric-Aware Abstraction (METRA). Our main idea is, instead of directly covering the entire state space, to only cover a compact latent space Z that is metrically connected to the state space S by temporal distances. By learning to move in every direction in the latent space, METRA obtains a tractable set of diverse behaviors that approximately cover the state space, being scalable to high-dimensional environments. Through our experiments in five locomotion and manipulation environments, we demonstrate that METRA can discover a variety of useful behaviors even in complex, pixel-based environments, being the first unsupervised RL method that discovers diverse locomotion behaviors in pixel-based Quadruped and Humanoid.

        "title": "TERNATING DENOISING DIFFUSION PROCESS",
        "abstract": "Image recognition and generation have long been developed independently of each other. With the recent trend towards general-purpose representation learning, the development of general representations for both recognition and generation tasks is also promoted. However, preliminary attempts mainly focus on generation performance, but are still inferior on recognition tasks. These methods are modeled in the vector-quantized (VQ) space, whereas leading recognition methods use pixels as inputs. Our key insights are twofold: (1) pixels as inputs are crucial for recognition tasks; (2) VQ tokens as reconstruction targets are beneficial for generation tasks. These observations motivate us to propose an Alternating Denoising Diffusion Process (ADDP) that integrates these two spaces within a single representation learning framework. In each denoising step, our method first decodes pixels from previous VQ tokens, then generates new VQ tokens from the decoded pixels. The diffusion process gradually masks out a portion of VQ tokens to construct the training samples. The learned representations can be used to generate diverse high-fidelity images and also demonstrate excellent transfer performance on recognition tasks. Extensive experiments show that our method achieves competitive performance on unconditional generation, ImageNet classification, COCO detection, and ADE20k segmentation. Importantly, our method represents the first successful development of general representations applicable to both generation and dense recognition tasks.

To solve this problem, we propose a method named Meta-Evolve that uses continuous robot evolution to efficiently transfer the policy to each target robot through a set of tree-structured evolutionary robot sequences.

To this end, we conduct experiments that disentangle the effect of mask learning and parameter optimization and how both benefit from overparameterization.

        "abstract": "Zero-shot learning in prompted vision-language models, the practice of crafting prompts to build classifiers without an explicit training process, has achieved impressive performance in many settings. This success presents a seemingly surprising observation: these methods suffer relatively little from overfitting, i.e., when a prompt is manually engineered to achieve low error on a given training set (thus rendering the method no longer actually zero-shot), the approach still performs well on held-out test data. In this paper, we show that we can explain such performance well via recourse to classical PAC-Bayes bounds. Specifically, we show that the discrete nature of prompts, combined with a PAC-Bayes prior given by a language model, results in generalization bounds that are remarkably tight by the standards of the literature: for instance, the generalization bound of an ImageNet classifier is often within a few percentage points of the true test error. We demonstrate empirically that this holds for existing handcrafted prompts and prompts generated through simple greedy search. Furthermore, the resulting bound is well-suited for model selection: the models with the best bound typically also have the best test performance. This work thus provides a possible justification for the widespread practice of \u201cprompt engineering,\u201d even if it seems that such methods could potentially overfit the training data.",

        "abstract": "Pretrained large language models (LLMs) are general purpose problem solvers applicable to a diverse set of tasks with prompts. They can be further improved towards a specific task by fine-tuning on a specialized dataset. However, fine-tuning usually makes the model narrowly specialized on this dataset with reduced general in-context learning performances, which is undesirable whenever the fine-tuned model needs to handle additional tasks where no fine-tuning data is available. In this work, we first demonstrate that fine-tuning on a single task indeed decreases LLMs\u2019 general in-context learning performance. We discover one important cause of such forgetting, format specialization, where the model overfits to the format of the fine-tuned task. We further show that format specialization happens at the very beginning of fine-tuning. To solve this problem, we propose Prompt Tuning with MOdel Tuning (ProMoT), a simple yet effective two-stage fine-tuning framework that reduces format specialization and improves generalization. ProMoT offloads task-specific format learning into additional and removable parameters by first doing prompt tuning and then fine-tuning the model itself with this soft prompt attached. With experiments on several fine-tuning tasks and 8 in-context evaluation tasks, we show that ProMoT achieves comparable performance on fine-tuned tasks to standard fine-tuning, but with much less loss of in-context learning performances across a board range of out-of-domain evaluation tasks. More importantly, ProMoT can even enhance generalization on in-context learning tasks that are semantically related to the fine-tuned task, e.g. ProMoT on En-Fr translation significantly improves performance on other language pairs, and ProMoT on NLI improves performance on summarization. Experiments also show that ProMoT can improve the generalization performance of multi-task training.",

        "abstract": "We study both stream-based and pool-based active learning with neural network approximations. A recent line of works proposed bandit-based approaches that transformed active learning into a bandit problem, achieving both theoretical and empirical success. However, the performance and computational costs of these methods may be susceptible to the number of classes, denoted as K, due to this transformation. Therefore, this paper seeks to answer the question: \"How can we mitigate the adverse impacts of K while retaining the advantages of principled exploration and provable performance guarantees in active learning?\" To tackle this challenge, we propose two algorithms based on the newly designed exploitation and exploration neural networks for stream-based and pool-based active learning. Subsequently, we provide theoretical performance guarantees for both algorithms in a non-parametric setting, demonstrating a slower error-growth rate concerning K for the proposed approaches. We use extensive experiments to evaluate the proposed algorithms, which consistently outperform state-of-the-art baselines.",

        "abstract": "One fascinating aspect of pre-trained vision-language models (VLMs) learning under language supervision is their impressive zero-shot generalization capability. However, this ability is hindered by distribution shifts between the training and testing data. Previous test time adaptation (TTA) methods for VLMs in zeroshot classification rely on minimizing the entropy of model outputs, tending to be stuck in incorrect model predictions. In this work, we propose TTA with feedback to rectify the model output and prevent the model from becoming blindly confident. Specifically, a CLIP model is adopted as the reward model during TTA and provides feedback for the VLM. Given a single test sample, the VLM is forced to maximize the CLIP reward between the input and sampled results from the VLM output distribution. The proposed reinforcement learning with CLIP feedback (RLCF) framework is highly flexible and universal. Beyond the classification task, with task-specific sampling strategies and a proper reward baseline choice, RLCF can be easily extended to not only discrimination tasks like retrieval but also generalization tasks like image captioning, improving the zero-shot generalization capacity of VLMs. According to the characteristics of these VL tasks, we build different fully TTA pipelines with RLCF to improve the zero-shot generalization ability of various VLMs. Extensive experiments along with promising empirical results demonstrate the effectiveness of RLCF.

In this paper, we present a degradation-aware visionlanguage model (DA-CLIP) to better transfer pretrained vision-language models to low-level vision tasks as a multi-task framework for image restoration. More specifically, DA-CLIP trains an additional controller that adapts the fixed CLIP image encoder to predict high-quality feature embeddings. By integrating the embedding into an image restoration network via cross-attention, we are able to pilot the model to learn a high-fidelity image reconstruction. The controller itself will also output a degradation feature that matches the real corruptions of the input, yielding a natural classifier for different degradation types.

Advanced FSSL methods predominantly focus on training a single model on each client. However, this approach could lead to a discrepancy between the objective functions of labeled and unlabeled data, resulting in gradient conflicts. To alleviate gradient conflict, we propose a novel twin-model paradigm, called Twin-sight, designed to enhance mutual guidance by providing insights from different perspectives of labeled and unlabeled data. In particular, Twin-sight concurrently trains a supervised model with a supervised objective function while training an unsupervised model using an unsupervised objective function. To enhance the synergy between these two models, Twin-sight introduces a neighbourhood-preserving constraint, which encourages the preservation of the neighbourhood relationship among data features extracted by both models. Our comprehensive experiments on four benchmark datasets provide substantial evidence that Twin-sight can significantly outperform state-of-the-art methods across various experimental settings, demonstrating the efficacy of the proposed Twin-sight.

        "abstract": "Optimization layers within neural network architectures have become increasingly popular for their ability to solve a wide range of machine learning tasks and to model domain-specific knowledge. However, designing optimization layers requires careful consideration as the underlying optimization problems might be infeasible during training. Motivated by applications in learning, control and robotics, this work focuses on convex quadratic programming (QP) layers. The specific structure of this type of optimization layer can be efficiently exploited for faster computations while still allowing rich modeling capabilities. We leverage primal-dual augmented Lagrangian techniques for computing derivatives of both feasible and infeasible QP solutions. More precisely, we propose a unified approach that tackles the differentiability of the closest feasible QP solutions in a classical l2 sense. The obtained Jacobian covers for feasible QPs the traditional implicit differentiation when it is valid and a weaker notion (i.e., conservative Jacobian) when it is infeasible. We then harness this approach to enrich the expressive capabilities of existing QP layers. More precisely, we show how differentiating through infeasible QPs during training enables to drive towards feasibility at test time a new range of QP layers. These layers notably demonstrate superior predictive performance in some conventional learning tasks. Additionally, we present alternative formulations that enhance numerical robustness, speed, and accuracy for training such layers. Along with these contributions, we provide an open-source C++ software package called QPLayer for differentiating feasible and infeasible convex QPs and which can be interfaced with modern learning frameworks.",

        "abstract": "Vertical federated learning (VFL), where each participating client holds a subset of data features, has found numerous applications in finance, healthcare, and IoT systems. However, adversarial attacks, particularly through the injection of adversarial examples (AEs), pose serious challenges to the security of VFL models. In this paper, we investigate such vulnerabilities through developing a novel attack to disrupt the VFL inference process, under a practical scenario where the adversary is able to adaptively corrupt a subset of clients. We formulate the problem of finding optimal attack strategies as an online optimization problem, which is decomposed into an inner problem of adversarial example generation (AEG) and an outer problem of corruption pattern selection (CPS). Specifically, we establish the equivalence between the formulated CPS problem and a multiarmed bandit (MAB) problem, and propose the Thompson sampling with Empirical maximum reward (E-TS) algorithm for the adversary to efficiently identify the optimal subset of clients for corruption. The key idea of E-TS is to introduce an estimation of the expected maximum reward for each arm, which helps to specify a small set of competitive arms, on which the exploration for the optimal arm is performed. This significantly reduces the exploration space, which otherwise can quickly become prohibitively large as the number of clients increases. We analytically characterize the regret bound of E-TS, and empirically demonstrate its capability of efficiently revealing the optimal corruption pattern with the highest attack success rate, under various datasets of popular VFL tasks.",

        "abstract": "We present chain-of-knowledge (CoK) , a novel framework that augments large language models (LLMs) by dynamically incorporating grounding information from heterogeneous sources. It results in more factual rationales and reduced hallucination in generation. Specifically, CoK consists of three stages: reasoning preparation, dynamic knowledge adapting, and answer consolidation. Given a knowledge-intensive question, CoK first prepares several preliminary rationales and answers while identifying the relevant knowledge domains. If there is no majority consensus among the answers from samples, CoK corrects the rationales step by step by adapting knowledge from the identified domains. These corrected rationales can plausibly serve as a better foundation for the final answer consolidation. Unlike prior studies that primarily use unstructured data, CoK also leverages structured knowledge sources such as Wikidata and tables that provide more reliable factual information. To access both unstructured and structured knowledge sources in the dynamic knowledge adapting stage, we propose an adaptive query generator that allows the generation of queries for various types of query languages, including SPARQL, SQL, and natural sentences. Moreover, to minimize error propagation between rationales, CoK corrects the rationales progressively using preceding corrected rationales to generate and correct subsequent rationales. Extensive experiments show that CoK consistently improves the performance of LLMs on knowledge-intensive tasks across different domains.

        "title": "HOW OVER-PARAMETERIZATION SLOWS DOWN GRA-",
        "abstract": "This paper rigorously shows how over-parameterization dramatically changes the convergence behaviors of gradient descent (GD) for the matrix sensing problem, where the goal is to recover an unknown low-rank ground-truth matrix from nearisotropic linear measurements. First, we consider the symmetric setting with the symmetric parameterization where M\u2217 \u2208 Rn\u00d7n is a positive semi-definite unknown matrix of rank r \u226a n, and one uses a symmetric parameterization XX\u22a4 to learn M\u2217. Here, X \u2208 Rn\u00d7k with k > r is the factor matrix. We give a novel \u03a9 ( 1/T 2 ) lower bound of randomly initialized GD for the over-parameterized case (k > r) where T is the number of iterations. This is in stark contrast to the exact-parameterization scenario (k = r) where the convergence rate is exp (\u2212\u03a9 (T )). Next, we study asymmetric setting where M\u2217 \u2208 Rn1\u00d7n2 is the unknown matrix of rank r \u226a min{n1, n2}, and one uses an asymmetric parameterization FG\u22a4 to learn M\u2217 where F \u2208 Rn1\u00d7k and G \u2208 Rn2\u00d7k. Building on prior work, we give a global exact convergence result of randomly initialized GD for the exact-parameterization case (k = r) with an exp (\u2212\u03a9 (T )) rate. Furthermore, we give the first global exact convergence result for the over-parameterization case (k > r) with an exp ( \u2212\u03a9 ( \u03b1T )) rate where \u03b1 is the initialization scale. This linear convergence result in the over-parameterization case is especially significant because one can apply the asymmetric parameterization to the symmetric setting to speed up from \u03a9 ( 1/T 2 ) to linear convergence. Therefore, we identify a surprising phenomenon: asymmetric parameterization can exponentially speed up convergence. Equally surprising is our analysis that highlights the importance of imbalance between F and G. This is in sharp contrast to prior works which emphasize balance. We further give an example showing the dependency on \u03b1 in the convergence rate is unavoidable in the worst case. On the other hand, we propose a novel method that only modifies one step of GD and obtains a convergence rate independent of \u03b1, recovering the rate in the exact-parameterization case. We provide empirical studies to verify our theoretical findings.",

To address these issues, we propose GEN-Z\u2014a generative prompting framework for zero-shot text classification. GEN-Z is generative, as it measures the LM likelihood of input text, conditioned on natural language descriptions of labels. The framework is multivariate, as label descriptions allow us to seamlessly integrate additional contextual information about the labels to improve task performance. On various standard classification benchmarks, with six open-source LM families, we show that zero-shot classification with simple contextualization of the data source of the evaluation set consistently outperforms both zero-shot and few-shot baselines while improving robustness to prompt variations. Further, our approach enables personalizing classification in a zero-shot manner by incorporating author, subject, or reader information in the label descriptions.",

Existing methods, which rely on sliding windows to process long sequences, struggle to effectively capture long-term variations that are partially caught within the short window (i.e., outer-window variations).

To this end, our contrastive loss incorporates global autocorrelation held in the whole time series, which facilitates the construction of positive and negative pairs in a self-supervised manner. When combined with our decomposition networks, our contrastive learning significantly improves long-term forecasting performance. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach outperforms 14 baseline models in multiple experiments over nine long-term benchmarks, especially in challenging scenarios that require a significantly long output for forecasting.

        "abstract": "Reinforcement learning (RL) for complex tasks remains a challenge, primarily due to the difficulties of engineering scalar reward functions and the inherent inefficiency of training models from scratch. Instead, it would be better to specify complex tasks in terms of elementary subtasks and to reuse subtask solutions whenever possible. In this work, we address continuous space lexicographic multi-objective RL problems, consisting of prioritized subtasks, which are notoriously difficult to solve. We show that these can be scalarized with a subtask transformation and then solved incrementally using value decomposition. Exploiting this insight, we propose prioritized soft Q-decomposition (PSQD), a novel algorithm for learning and adapting subtask solutions under lexicographic priorities in continuous state-action spaces. PSQD offers the ability to reuse previously learned subtask solutions in a zero-shot composition, followed by an adaptation step. Its ability to use retained subtask training data for offline learning eliminates the need for new environment interaction during adaptation. We demonstrate the efficacy of our approach by presenting successful learning, reuse, and adaptation results for both lowand high-dimensional simulated robot control tasks, as well as offline learning results. In contrast to baseline approaches, PSQD does not trade off between conflicting subtasks or priority constraints and satisfies subtask priorities during learning.

Given the lack of data, limited resources, semantic context requirements, and so on, this work focuses on TSfor-LLM, where we aim to activate LLM\u2019s ability for TS data by designing a TS embedding method suitable for LLM. The proposed method is named TEST.

We also demonstrate the feasibility of TS-for-LLM through theory and experiments. Experiments are carried out on TS classification, forecasting, and representation tasks using eight frozen LLMs with various structures and sizes. The results show that the pre-trained LLM with TEST strategy can achieve better or comparable performance than today\u2019s SOTA TS models and offer benefits for few-shot and generalization.

        "abstract": "Transparent machine learning (ML) models are essential for ensuring interpretability and trustworthiness in decision-making systems, particularly in highstakes domains such as healthcare, finance, and criminal justice. While transparent machine learning models have been proposed for classification and regression, time series forecasting presents some unique challenges for ensuring transparency. In particular, currently used bottom-up approaches that focus on the values of the time series at specific time points (usually regularly spaced) do not provide a holistic understanding of the entire time series. This limits the applicability of ML in many critical areas. To open up these domains for ML, we propose a top-down framework of bi-level transparency, which involves understanding the higher-level trends and the lower-level properties of the predicted time series. Applying this framework, we develop TIMEVIEW, a transparent ML model for time series forecasting based on static features, complemented with an interactive visualization tool. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy and interpretability of our approach, paving the way for more transparent and reliable applications of ML in various domains.",

        "title": "FEDWON: TRIUMPHING MULTI-DOMAIN FEDERATED LEARNING WITHOUT NORMALIZATION",
        "abstract": "Federated learning (FL) enhances data privacy with collaborative in-situ training on decentralized clients. Nevertheless, FL encounters challenges due to nonindependent and identically distributed (non-i.i.d) data, leading to potential performance degradation and hindered convergence. While prior studies predominantly addressed the issue of skewed label distribution, our research addresses a crucial yet frequently overlooked problem known as multi-domain FL. In this scenario, clients\u2019 data originate from diverse domains with distinct feature distributions, instead of label distributions. To address the multi-domain problem in FL, we propose a novel method called Federated learning Without normalizations (FedWon). FedWon draws inspiration from the observation that batch normalization (BN) faces challenges in effectively modeling the statistics of multiple domains, while existing normalization techniques possess their own limitations. In order to address these issues, FedWon eliminates the normalization layers in FL and reparameterizes convolution layers with scaled weight standardization. Through extensive experimentation on five datasets and five models, our comprehensive experimental results demonstrate that FedWon surpasses both FedAvg and the current state-of-the-art method (FedBN) across all experimental setups, achieving notable accuracy improvements of more than 10% in certain domains. Furthermore, FedWon is versatile for both cross-silo and cross-device FL, exhibiting robust domain generalization capability, showcasing strong performance even with a batch size as small as 1, thereby catering to resource-constrained devices. Additionally, FedWon can also effectively tackle the challenge of skewed label distribution.",

In this paper, we introduce Matryoshka Diffusion (MDM), a novel framework for high-resolution image and video synthesis. We propose a diffusion process that denoises inputs at multiple resolutions jointly and uses a NestedUNet architecture where features and parameters for small scale inputs are nested within those of the large scales. In addition, MDM enables a progressive training schedule from lower to higher resolutions which leads to significant improvements in optimization for high-resolution generation. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on various benchmarks, including class-conditioned image generation, high-resolution text-to-image, and text-to-video applications.

        "abstract": "This paper introduces GenCorres, a novel unsupervised joint shape matching (JSM) approach. Our key idea is to learn a mesh generator to fit an unorganized deformable shape collection while constraining deformations between adjacent synthetic shapes to preserve geometric structures such as local rigidity and local conformality. GenCorres presents three appealing advantages over existing JSM techniques. First, GenCorres performs JSM among a synthetic shape collection whose size is much bigger than the input shapes and fully leverages the datadriven power of JSM. Second, GenCorres unifies consistent shape matching and pairwise matching (i.e., by enforcing deformation priors between adjacent synthetic shapes). Third, the generator provides a concise encoding of consistent shape correspondences. However, learning a mesh generator from an unorganized shape collection is challenging, requiring a good initialization. GenCorres addresses this issue by learning an implicit generator from the input shapes, which provides intermediate shapes between two arbitrary shapes. We introduce a novel approach for computing correspondences between adjacent implicit surfaces, which we use to regularize the implicit generator. Synthetic shapes of the implicit generator then guide initial fittings (i.e., via template-based deformation) for learning the mesh generator. Experimental results show that GenCorres considerably outperforms state-of-the-art JSM techniques. The synthetic shapes of GenCorres also achieve salient performance gains against state-of-the-art deformable shape generators.",

        "abstract": "Universal domain adaptation aims to align the classes and reduce the feature gap between the same category of the source and target domains. The target private category is set as the unknown class during the adaptation process, as it is not included in the source domain. However, most existing methods overlook the intra-class structure within a category, especially in cases where there exists significant concept shift between the samples belonging to the same category. When samples with large concept shifts are forced to be pushed together, it may negatively affect the adaptation performance. Moreover, from the interpretability aspect, it is unreasonable to align visual features with significant differences, such as fighter jets and civil aircraft, into the same category. Unfortunately, due to such semantic ambiguity and annotation cost, categories are not always classified in detail, making it difficult for the model to perform precise adaptation. To address these issues, we propose a novel Memory-Assisted Sub-Prototype Mining (MemSPM) method that can learn the differences between samples belonging to the same category and mine sub-classes when there exists significant concept shift between them. By doing so, our model learns a more reasonable feature space that enhances the transferability and reflects the inherent differences among samples annotated as the same category. We evaluate the effectiveness of our MemSPM method over multiple scenarios, including UniDA, OSDA, and PDA. Our method achieves state-of-the-art performance on four benchmarks in most cases.",

        "title": "QA-LORA: QUANTIZATION-AWARE LOW-RANK ADAPTATION OF LARGE LANGUAGE MODELS",
        "abstract": "Recently years have witnessed a rapid development of large language models (LLMs). Despite the strong ability in many language-understanding tasks, the heavy computational burden largely restricts the application of LLMs especially when one needs to deploy them onto edge devices. In this paper, we propose a quantization-aware low-rank adaptation (QA-LoRA) algorithm. The motivation lies in the imbalanced numbers of parameters for quantization and adaptation, and the solution is to use group-wise operators to increase the number of parameters for quantization meanwhile decreasing that of adaptation. QA-LoRA is easily implemented with a few lines of code, and it equips the original LoRA with two-fold abilities: (i) during fine-tuning, the LLM\u2019s weights are quantized (e.g., into INT4) to reduce time and memory usage; (ii) after fine-tuning, the LLM and auxiliary weights are naturally integrated into a quantized model without loss of accuracy. We apply QA-LoRA to the LLaMA and LLaMA2 model families and validate its effectiveness in different fine-tuning datasets and downstream scenarios.

The motivation is to integrate parameter-efficient fine-tuning with low-bit quantization to reduce the computational burden and improve the scalability of LLMs. The proposed approach is based on the imbalanced numbers of parameters for quantization and adaptation, and it introduces group-wise operators to increase the number of parameters for low-bit quantization and decrease that of LoRA. The algorithm is easily implemented and can be generalized across various foundation models and language understanding tasks.\n\nThe paper has two main contributions: (1) the development of a simple yet effective method for joint quantization and adaptation of LLMs, and (2) the evaluation of QA-LoRA on various language understanding benchmarks, including MMLU and HellaSwag.

Furthermore, such approaches often lead to intractable optimization problems in real-world imaging applications. Here we present a new paradigm for experimental design that simultaneously optimizes the design (set of image channels) and trains a machine-learning model to execute a userspecified image-analysis task. The approach obtains data densely-sampled over the measurement space (many image channels) for a small number of acquisitions, then identifies a subset of channels of prespecified size that best supports the task. We propose a method: TADRED for TAsk-DRiven Experimental Design in imaging, to identify the most informative channel-subset whilst simultaneously training a network to execute the task given the subset. Experiments demonstrate the potential of TADRED in diverse imaging applications: several clinicallyrelevant tasks in magnetic resonance imaging; and remote sensing and physiological applications of hyperspectral imaging.

Highquality medical fairness datasets are needed to promote fairness learning research. Existing medical fairness datasets are all for classification tasks, and no fairness datasets are available for medical segmentation, while medical segmentation is an equally important clinical task as classifications, which can provide detailed spatial information on organ abnormalities ready to be assessed by clinicians. In this paper, we propose the first fairness dataset for medical segmentation named Harvard-FairSeg with 10,000 subject samples. In addition, we propose a fair error-bound scaling approach to reweight the loss function with the upper error-bound in each identity group, using the segment anything model (SAM). We anticipate that the segmentation performance equity can be improved by explicitly tackling the hard cases with high training errors in each identity group. To facilitate fair comparisons, we utilize a novel equity-scaled segmentation performance metric to compare segmentation metrics in the context of fairness, such as the equity-scaled Dice coefficient. Through comprehensive experiments, we demonstrate that our fair error-bound scaling approach either has superior or comparable fairness performance to the state-of-theart fairness learning models.

        "abstract": "Exposing meaningful and interpretable neural interactions is critical to understanding neural circuits. Inferred neural interactions from neural signals primarily reflect functional connectivity. In a long experiment, subject animals may experience different stages defined by the experiment, stimuli, or behavioral states, and hence functional connectivity can change over time. To model dynamically changing functional connectivity, prior work employs state-switching generalized linear models with hidden Markov models (i.e., HMM-GLMs). However, we argue they lack biological plausibility, as functional connectivities are shaped and confined by the underlying anatomical connectome. Here, we propose two novel priorinformed state-switching GLMs, called Gaussian HMM-GLM (Gaussian prior) and one-hot HMM-GLM (Gumbel-Softmax one-hot prior). We show that the learned prior should capture the state-invariant interaction, shedding light on the underlying anatomical connectome and revealing more likely physical neuron interactions. The state-dependent interaction modeled by each GLM offers traceability to capture functional variations across multiple brain states. Our methods effectively recover true interaction structures in simulated data, achieve the highest predictive likelihood, and enhance the interpretability of interaction patterns and hidden states when applied to real neural data.

The min-max problem has attracted increasing attention because of its applications in machine learning tasks such as generative adversarial networks (GANs) training. While there has been exhaustive research on convex-concave setting, problem of nonconvex-nonconcave setting faces many challenges, such as convergence to limit cycles. Given that general min-max optimization has been found to be intractable, recent research efforts have shifted towards tackling structured problems. One of these follows the weak Minty variational inequality (weak MVI), which is motivated by relaxing Minty variational inequality (MVI) without compromising convergence guarantee of extragradient algorithm. Existing extragradient-type algorithms involve one exploration step and one update step per iteration. We analyze the algorithms with multiple exploration steps and show that current assumption can be further relaxed when more exploration is introduced.

        "abstract": "Training and deploying machine learning models that meet fairness criteria for protected groups are fundamental in modern artificial intelligence. While numerous constraints and regularization terms have been proposed in the literature to promote fairness in machine learning tasks, most of these approaches are not amenable to stochastic optimization due to the complex and nonlinear structure of constraints and regularizers. Here, the term \u201cstochastic\u201d refers to the ability of the algorithm to work with small mini-batches of data. Motivated by the limitation of existing literature, this paper presents a unified stochastic optimization framework for fair empirical risk minimization based on f -divergence measures (f -FERM). The proposed stochastic algorithm enjoys theoretical convergence guarantees. In addition, our experiments demonstrate the superiority of fairness-accuracy tradeoffs offered by f -FERM for almost all batch sizes (ranging from full-batch to batch size of one). Moreover, we show that our framework can be extended to the case where there is a distribution shift from training to the test data. Our extension is based on a distributionally robust optimization reformulation of f -FERM objective under lp norms as uncertainty sets. Again, in this distributionally robust setting, f -FERM not only enjoys theoretical convergence guarantees but also outperforms other baselines in the literature in the tasks involving distribution shifts. An efficient stochastic implementation of f -FERM is publicly available 1.",

However, contrasting similar time series instances or values from adjacent timestamps within a time series leads to ignore their inherent correlations, which results in deteriorating the quality of learned representations. To address this issue, we propose SoftCLT, a simple yet effective soft contrastive learning strategy for time series. This is achieved by introducing instance-wise and temporal contrastive loss with soft assignments ranging from zero to one. Specifically, we define soft assignments for 1) instance-wise contrastive loss by the distance between time series on the data space, and 2) temporal contrastive loss by the difference of timestamps. SoftCLT is a plug-and-play method for time series contrastive learning that improves the quality of learned representations without bells and whistles. In experiments, we demonstrate that SoftCLT consistently improves the performance in various downstream tasks including classification, semi-supervised learning, transfer learning, and anomaly detection, showing stateof-the-art performance.

        "abstract": "Estimating neural radiance fields (NeRFs) is able to generate novel views of a scene from known imagery. Recent approaches have afforded dramatic progress on small bounded regions of the scene. For an unbounded scene where cameras point in any direction and contents exist at any distance, certain mapping functions are used to represent it within a bounded space, yet they either work in object-centric scenes or focus on objects close to the camera. The goal of this paper is to understand how to design a proper mapping function that considers per-scene optimization, which remains unexplored. We first present a geometric understanding of existing mapping functions that express the relation between the bounded and unbounded scenes. Here, we exploit a stereographic projection method to explain failures of the mapping functions, where input ray samples are too sparse to account for scene geometry in unbounded regions. To overcome the failures, we propose a novel mapping function based on a p-norm distance, allowing to adaptively sample the rays by adjusting the p-value according to scene geometry, even in unbounded regions. To take the advantage of our mapping function, we also introduce a new ray parameterization to properly allocate ray samples in the geometry of unbounded regions. Through the incorporation of both the novel mapping function and the ray parameterization within existing NeRF frameworks, our method achieves state-ofthe-art novel view synthesis results on a variety of challenging datasets.",

        "peer_review_with_watermark": "$$$Abstract:\nThis paper proposes a novel approach to neural radiance field (NeRF) rendering for unbounded scenes. The proposed method uses a p-norm-based mapping function to adaptively sample points on rays, allowing for efficient rendering of distant objects. The angular ray parameterization is also introduced to preserve the relative distance between points across varying manifold shapes. The proposed method is compared to state-of-the-art methods on various datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in rendering unbounded scenes. \n\nThe proposed approach is based on the idea of using a p-norm-based mapping function to adaptively sample points on rays. The p-norm distance metric is used to define the mapping function, which is able to deform the surface of the embedding space depending on the scene configurations. A large p makes the surface convex and allocates more capacity to nearby contents on the finite volume, while a small p induces the concave of the surface, which leads to a larger capacity to distant contents. The parameter p is automatically set using a RANSAC framework, which randomly chooses certain 3D points from a point cloud in a scene and then iteratively projects them onto the embedding space. The maximum distance is used to find the final p value, which exploits the full capacity of the embedding space. \n\nThe proposed angular ray parameterization is formulated as follows: \u03b8 = \u2220(x\u2212Q, o\u2212Q), \u03b8max = \u2220(d\u2212Q, o\u2212Q). This parameterization is able to preserve the relative distance between points across varying manifold shapes, and is able to avoid over- and under-sampling problems. \n\nThe proposed method is compared to state-of-the-art methods on various datasets, including mip-NeRF 360, Tanks and Temples, and Free dataset. The quantitative evaluations demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method in rendering unbounded scenes. The qualitative results also show that the proposed method can produce visually-pleasing results, even when the camera poses are far from the scene origin. \n\nThe proposed approach has several advantages over existing methods. Firstly, it is able to handle unbounded scenes more efficiently, allowing for the rendering of distant objects. Secondly, it is able to adaptively sample points on rays, which is able to preserve the relative distance between points across varying manifold shapes. \n\nThe proposed approach also has some limitations. Firstly, it requires a large amount of computational resources to train the model. Secondly, it may not be able to handle scenes with complex geometries. \n\nIn conclusion, the proposed approach is a novel and effective method for rendering unbounded scenes using NeRF. It uses a p-norm-based mapping function to adaptively sample points on rays, and an angular ray parameterization to preserve the relative distance between points across varying manifold shapes. The proposed method is compared to state-of-the-art methods on various datasets, demonstrating its effectiveness in rendering unbounded scenes. \n\nRecommendation:\nThe proposed approach is recommended for use in rendering unbounded scenes using NeRF. It is particularly useful for scenes with distant objects, and is able to handle scenes with complex geometries. \n\nImprovement suggestions:\n1. The proposed approach requires a large amount of computational resources to train the model. To address this, the approach could be modified to use more efficient training methods, or to reduce the number of parameters in the model.\n2. The proposed approach may not be able to handle scenes with complex geometries. To address this, the approach could be modified to use more advanced geometric representations, or to use techniques such as multi-scale rendering.\n3. The proposed approach uses a RANSAC framework to automatically set the parameter p. To improve the robustness of the approach, the framework could be modified to use more advanced techniques, such as iterative refinement or multi-resolution rendering.\n4.

In this paper, we introduce a novel approach for learning spatiotemporal structure and using it to improve the application of transformers to timeseries datasets. Our framework learns a set of group tokens, and builds an instance-specific group embedding (GE) layer that assigns input tokens to a small number of group tokens to incorporate structure into learning. We then introduce a novel architecture, GroupAware transFormer (GAFormer), which incorporates both spatial and temporal group embeddings to achieve state-of-the-art performance on a number of timeseries classification and regression tasks. In evaluations on a number of diverse timeseries datasets, we show that GE on its own can provide a nice enhancement to a number of backbones, and that by coupling spatial and temporal group embeddings, the GAFormer can outperform the existing baselines. Finally, we show how our approach discerns latent structures in data even without information about the spatial ordering of channels, and yields a more interpretable decomposition of spatial and temporal structure underlying complex multivariate datasets.",

        "abstract": "Retrosynthetic planning is a sequential decision-making process of identifying synthetic routes from the available building block materials to reach a desired target molecule. Though existing planning approaches show promisingly high solving rates and route qualities, the trivial route quality evaluation via pre-trained forward reaction prediction models certainly falls short of real-world chemical practice. An alternative option is to annotate the actual quality of a route, such as yield, through chemical experiments or input from chemists, but this often leads to substantial query costs. In order to strike the balance between query costs and route quality evaluation, we propose an Active Retrosynthetic Planning (ARP) framework that remains compatible with the established retrosynthetic planners. On one hand, the proposed ARP trains an actor that decides whether to query the quality of a reaction; on the other hand, it resorts to a critic to estimate the value of a molecule with its preceding reaction quality as input. Those molecules with high reaction qualities are preferred to expand first.

Existing planning approaches show promisingly high solving rates and route qualities, but the trivial route quality evaluation via pre-trained forward reaction prediction models falls short of real-world chemical practice. This paper proposes an Active Retrosynthetic Planning (ARP) framework that strikes a balance between query costs and route quality evaluation. The proposed ARP trains an actor that decides whether to query the quality of a reaction and a critic that estimates the value of a molecule with its preceding reaction quality as input. The results demonstrate that ARP outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approach by 6.2% in route quality while reducing the query cost by 12.8%.\n\nSummary:\nThe paper proposes an Active Retrosynthetic Planning (ARP) framework that addresses the issue of trivial route quality evaluation in existing planning approaches.

ARP is a reinforcement learning-based framework that remains compatible with existing retrosynthetic planners. The proposed framework trains an actor that decides whether to query the quality of a reaction, and a critic that estimates the value of a molecule with its preceding reaction quality as input. The framework is applied to different existing approaches on both the benchmark and an expert dataset, demonstrating that it outperforms the existing state-of-the-art approach by 6.2% in route quality while reducing the query cost by 12.8%. The results show that ARP consistently plans high-quality routes with either abundant or sparse annotations.\n\n\\# Strengths:\n1. The proposed framework addresses the issue of trivial reaction quality evaluation in existing planning approaches, which is biased towards highly feasible and frequent reactions.\n2. The framework is compatible with arbitrary off-the-shelf planners and further boosts their chemical practicality.\n3. The use of a critic network that evaluates the value of molecules based on their preceding reaction quality as input is an innovative approach.\n4. The experimental results demonstrate the capability of ARP in capturing high-quality routes under either abundant or sparse-annotation environments.\n\n\\# Weaknesses:\n1. The paper does not provide a detailed analysis of the reaction quality evaluation approach, which may be a potential limitation of the framework.\n2. The use of a surrogate model for reaction quality annotation may not be robust in all scenarios, especially in the context of sparse-annotated environments.\n3. The experimental results may be biased towards the specific datasets used, which may not be representative of the broader chemical synthesis community.\n4. The framework may not be able to handle the case where the reaction quality evaluation approach is not able to accurately predict the reaction qualities, which may lead to sub-optimal planning decisions.\n\n\\# Suggestions for Improvement:\n1. Provide a more detailed analysis of the reaction quality evaluation approach, including its limitations and potential biases.\n2. Experiment with different reaction quality evaluation approaches, such as using expert annotations or lab verification, to evaluate the robustness of the framework.\n3. Use a more diverse set of datasets to evaluate the framework, including datasets with different reaction qualities, molecular structures, and synthesis conditions.\n4. Implement a more robust query cost mechanism, such as using a cost function that takes into account the query cost and the reaction quality, to optimize the search process.\n\n\\# Recommendation:\nBased on the experimental results, the proposed ARP framework is a promising approach for active retrosynthetic planning. However, further work is needed to address the limitations and potential biases of the framework, such as the reaction quality evaluation approach and the use of a surrogate model for reaction quality annotation. Additionally, the framework should be tested with a more diverse set of datasets to evaluate its robustness in different scenarios. If these limitations are addressed, the framework has the potential to be a valuable tool for active retrosynthetic planning in the chemical synthesis community.",

        "abstract": "Despite their impressive capabilities, large language models (LLMs) are prone to hallucinations, i.e., generating content that deviates from facts seen during pretraining. We propose a simple decoding strategy for reducing hallucinations with pretrained LLMs that does not require conditioning on retrieved external knowledge nor additional finetuning. Our approach obtains the next-token distribution by contrasting the differences in logits obtained from projecting the later layers versus earlier layers to the vocabulary space, exploiting the fact that factual knowledge in an LLMs has generally been shown to be localized to particular transformer layers. We find that this Decoding by Contrasting Layers (DoLa) approach is able to better surface factual knowledge and reduce the generation of incorrect facts. DoLa consistently improves the truthfulness across multiple choices tasks and open-ended generation tasks, for example improving the performance of LLaMA family models on TruthfulQA by 12-17% absolute points, demonstrating its potential in making LLMs reliably generate truthful facts.1",

        "abstract": "Equipping agents with the capacity to justify made decisions using supporting evidence represents a cornerstone of accountable decision-making. Furthermore, ensuring that justifications are in line with human expectations and societal norms is vital, especially in high-stakes situations such as healthcare. In this work, we propose the use of a debate-based reward model for reinforcement learning agents, where the outcome of a zero-sum debate game quantifies the justifiability of a decision in a particular state. This reward model is then used to train a justifiable policy, whose decisions can be more easily corroborated with supporting evidence. In the debate game, two argumentative agents take turns providing supporting evidence for two competing decisions. Given the proposed evidence, a proxy of a human judge evaluates which decision is better justified. We demonstrate the potential of our approach in learning policies for prescribing and justifying treatment decisions of septic patients. We show that augmenting the reward with the feedback signal generated by the debate-based reward model yields policies highly favored by the judge when compared to the policy obtained solely from the environment rewards, while hardly sacrificing any performance. Moreover, in terms of the overall performance and justifiability of trained policies, the debate-based feedback is comparable to the feedback obtained from an ideal judge proxy that evaluates decisions using the full information encoded in the state. This suggests that the debate game outputs key information contained in states that is most relevant for evaluating decisions, which in turn substantiates the practicality of combining our approach with human-in-the-loop evaluations. Lastly, we showcase that agents trained via multi-agent debate learn to propose evidence that is resilient to refutations and closely aligns with human preferences.",

One critical driving principle behind it is perceptual grouping (Palmer, 2002; Wagemans et al., 2012; Herzog, 2018). Despite being widely used in computer vision in the early 2010s, it remains a mystery whether perceptual grouping can be leveraged to derive a neural visual recognition backbone that generates as powerful representations. In this paper, we propose the Perceptual Group Tokenizer, a model that entirely relies on grouping operations to extract visual features and perform self-supervised representation learning, where a series of grouping operations are used to iteratively hypothesize the context for pixels or superpixels to refine feature representations. We show that the proposed model can achieve competitive performance compared to state-of-the-art vision architectures, and inherits desirable properties including adaptive computation without re-training, and interpretability. Specifically, Perceptual Group Tokenizer achieves 80.3% on ImageNet-1K self-supervised learning benchmark with linear probe evaluation, establishing a new milestone for this paradigm.",

        "abstract": "The progress of autonomous web navigation has been hindered by the dependence on billions of exploratory interactions via online reinforcement learning, and domain-specific model designs that make it difficult to leverage generalization from rich out-of-domain data. In this work, we study data-driven offline training for web agents with vision-language foundation models. We propose an instruction-following multimodal agent, WebGUM, that observes both webpage screenshots and HTML pages and outputs web navigation actions, such as click and type. WebGUM is trained by jointly finetuning an instruction-finetuned language model and a vision encoder with temporal and local perception on a large corpus of demonstrations. We empirically demonstrate this recipe improves the agent\u2019s ability of grounded multimodal perception, HTML comprehension, and multi-step reasoning, outperforming prior works by a significant margin. On the MiniWoB, we improve over the previous best offline methods by more than 45.8%, even outperforming online-finetuned SoTA, humans, and GPT-4-based agent. On the WebShop benchmark, our 3-billion-parameter model achieves superior performance to the existing SoTA, PaLM-540B. Furthermore, WebGUM exhibits strong positive transfer to the real-world planning tasks on the Mind2Web. We also collect 347K high-quality demonstrations using our trained models, 38 times larger than prior work, and make them available to promote future research in this direction.",

        "title": "PERTURBATION-BASED GNN EXPLAINERS THROUGH",
        "abstract": "Numerous explainability methods have been proposed to shed light on the inner workings of GNNs. Despite the inclusion of empirical evaluations in all the proposed algorithms, the interrogative aspects of these evaluations lack diversity. As a result, various facets of explainability pertaining to GNNs, such as a comparative analysis of counterfactual reasoners, their stability to variational factors such as different GNN architectures, noise, stochasticity in non-convex loss surfaces, feasibility amidst domain constraints, and so forth, have yet to be formally investigated. Motivated by this need, we present a benchmarking study on perturbation-based explainability methods for GNNs, aiming to systematically evaluate and compare a wide range of explainability techniques. Among the key findings of our study, we identify the Pareto-optimal methods that exhibit superior efficacy and stability in the presence of noise. Nonetheless, our study reveals that all algorithms are affected by stability issues when faced with noisy data. Furthermore, we have established that the current generation of counterfactual explainers often fails to provide feasible recourses due to violations of topological constraints encoded by domain-specific considerations. Overall, this benchmarking study empowers stakeholders in the field of GNNs with a comprehensive understanding of the state-of-the-art explainability methods, potential research problems for further enhancement, and the implications of their application in real-world scenarios.",

        "title": "SELF-CONSUMING GENERATIVE MODELS GO MAD",
        "abstract": "Seismic advances in generative AI algorithms for imagery, text, and other data types have led to the temptation to use AI-synthesized data to train next-generation models. Repeating this process creates an autophagous (\u201cself-consuming\u201d) loop whose properties are poorly understood. We conduct a thorough analytical and empirical analysis using state-of-the-art generative image models of three families of autophagous loops that differ in how fixed or fresh real training data is available through the generations of training and whether the samples from previous-generation models have been biased to trade off data quality versus diversity. Our primary conclusion across all scenarios is that without enough fresh real data in each generation of an autophagous loop, future generative models are doomed to have their quality (precision) or diversity (recall) progressively decrease. We term this condition Model Autophagy Disorder (MAD), by analogy to mad cow disease, and show that appreciable MADness arises in just a few generations. Generation t = 1 t = 3 t = 5 t = 7 t = 9 Figure 1: Training generative artificial intelligence (AI) models on synthetic data progressively amplifies artifacts. As AI-synthesized data proliferates in standard datasets and the Internet, future AI models will train on both real and synthetic data, forming autophagous (\u201cself-consuming\u201d) loops. Here we highlight a potential unintended consequence of autophagous training. We trained a sequence of StyleGAN2 (Karras et al., 2019a) models wherein the model at generation t \u2265 2 trains only on data synthesized by the model at generation t\u2212 1. This setup is a fully synthetic loop (Figure 3) without sampling bias (\u03bb = 1). Note how the cross-hatched artifacts (possibly an architectural fingerprint (Karras et al., 2021)) are progressively amplified at each generation. Appendix D has more samples.",

        "abstract": "Current privacy research on large language models (LLMs) primarily focuses on the issue of extracting memorized training data. At the same time, models\u2019 inference capabilities have increased drastically. This raises the key question of whether current LLMs could violate individuals\u2019 privacy by inferring personal attributes from text given at inference time. In this work, we present the first comprehensive study on the capabilities of pretrained LLMs to infer personal attributes from text. We construct a dataset consisting of real Reddit profiles, and show that current LLMs can infer a wide range of personal attributes (e.g., location, income, sex), achieving up to 85% top-1 and 95% top-3 accuracy at a fraction of the cost (100\u00d7) and time (240\u00d7) required by humans. As people increasingly interact with LLM-powered chatbots across all aspects of life, we also explore the emerging threat of privacy-invasive chatbots trying to extract personal information through seemingly benign questions. Finally, we show that common mitigations, i.e., text anonymization and model alignment, are currently ineffective at protecting user privacy against LLM inference. Our findings highlight that current LLMs can infer personal data at a previously unattainable scale. In the absence of working defenses, we advocate for a broader discussion around LLM privacy implications beyond memorization, striving for a wider privacy protection.",

Despite its promise, existing entity segmentation methods like Segment Anything Model (SAM) rely heavily on costly expert annotators. This work presents Self-supervised Open-world Hierarchical Entity Segmentation (SOHES), a novel approach that sidesteps the need for human annotations. SOHES operates in three phases: self-exploration, self-instruction, and self-correction. Given a pretrained self-supervised representation, we produce abundant high-quality pseudolabels through visual feature clustering. Then, we train a segmentation model on the pseudo-labels, and rectify the noises in pseudo-labels via a teacher-student mutual-learning procedure. Beyond segmenting entities, SOHES also captures their constituent parts, providing a hierarchical understanding of visual entities. Using raw images as the sole training data, our method achieves unprecedented performance in self-supervised open-world segmentation, marking a significant milestone towards high-quality open-world entity segmentation in the absence of human-annotated masks.",

        "abstract": "Protein design, a grand challenge of the day, involves optimization on a fitness landscape, and leading methods adopt a model-based approach where a model is trained on a training set (protein sequences and fitness) and proposes candidates to explore next. These methods are challenged by sparsity of high-fitness samples in the training set, a problem that has been in the literature. A less recognized but equally important problem stems from the distribution of training samples in the design space: leading methods are not designed for scenarios where the desired optimum is in a region that is not only poorly represented in training data, but also relatively far from the highly represented low-fitness regions. We show that this problem of \u201cseparation\u201d in the design space is a significant bottleneck in existing model-based optimization tools and propose a new approach that uses a novel VAE as its search model to overcome the problem. We demonstrate its advantage over prior methods in robustly finding improved samples, regardless of the imbalance and separation between lowand high-fitness training samples. Our comprehensive benchmark on real and semi-synthetic protein datasets as well as solution design for physics-informed neural networks, showcases the generality of our approach in discrete and continuous design spaces. Our implementation is available at https://github.com/sabagh1994/PGVAE.",
        "peer_review_without_watermark": "$$$\n\n\nPaper Summary:\nThe paper proposes a novel approach for model-based optimization (MBO) in challenging fitness landscapes, specifically in protein design. The authors address the twin challenges of imbalance and separation in the fitness landscape, where the desired optimum is rarely represented in the training set and is separated from the highly represented low-fitness regions. The proposed approach, called Property-Prioritized Generative Variational Auto-Encoder (PPGVAE), uses a novel VAE as its search model to overcome these challenges. The authors demonstrate the robustness of PPGVAE in finding improved samples in discrete and continuous design spaces, including real protein datasets and physics-informed neural networks (PINNs).\n\nStrengths:\n1. The authors address a significant challenge in MBO, namely the imbalance and separation in the fitness landscape, which is a common issue in protein design.\n2. The proposed approach, PPGVAE, is novel and innovative, using a property-prioritized VAE to overcome the challenges of imbalance and separation.\n3. The authors provide a comprehensive benchmark on real and semi-synthetic protein datasets, as well as PINNs, to demonstrate the robustness of PPGVAE.\n4. The authors provide a clear and concise explanation of the method, including the structural constraint on the latent space and the implications for sample generation.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. The authors assume that the training set is representative of the entire design space, which may not always be the case. This assumption may limit the generalizability of the approach.\n2. The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the hyperparameters, such as the temperature (\u03c4) and the weighting function, which may affect the performance of the approach.\n3. The authors rely on a simple VAE architecture, which may not be optimal for all design problems. More complex architectures, such as multi-modal VAEs, may be necessary for more challenging design problems.\n4. The authors do not provide a detailed analysis of the limitations of the approach, such as the potential for mode collapse or the impact of noise on the latent space.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. Provide a more detailed analysis of the hyperparameters and their impact on the performance of the approach.\n2. Explore the use of more complex VAE architectures, such as multi-modal VAEs, to improve the robustness of the approach.\n3. Investigate the use of additional exploratory mechanisms, such as Bayesian optimization or evolutionary algorithms, to improve the performance of the approach.\n4. Provide a more detailed analysis of the limitations of the approach and the potential for mode collapse or the impact of noise on the latent space.\n\nRecommendation:\nBased on the strengths and weaknesses of the approach, I recommend that the authors continue to develop and refine the PPGVAE approach. Specifically, I recommend that they:\n1. Conduct a more detailed analysis of the hyperparameters and their impact on the performance of the approach.\n2. Explore the use of more complex VAE architectures to improve the robustness of the approach.\n3. Investigate the use of additional exploratory mechanisms to improve the performance of the approach.\n4. Provide a more detailed analysis of the limitations of the approach and the potential for mode collapse or the impact of noise on the latent space.\n\nOverall, the PPGVAE approach shows promise in addressing the challenges of imbalance and separation in fitness landscapes, and further development and refinement of the approach are necessary to fully realize its potential.",
        "peer_review_with_watermark": "$$$ Paper Summary:\nThe authors propose a novel approach for model-based optimization (MBO) in challenging fitness landscapes, which is designed to overcome the problems of sparsity and separation in training samples. The proposed approach, called PPGVAE (Property-Prioritized Generative Variational Auto-Encoder), uses a VAE as the search model to prioritize the generation of rare, high-fitness samples. The authors demonstrate the robustness of PPGVAE in a series of experiments on real and semi-synthetic protein datasets, and show that it achieves consistent improvements over prior methods in less number of MBO steps and less sampling budget.\n\nStrengths:\n1. The authors provide a clear and well-structured explanation of the problem and the proposed approach.\n2. The use of VAE as the search model is a novel and effective approach to prioritize the generation of rare, high-fitness samples.\n3. The authors provide a comprehensive set of experiments to demonstrate the robustness of PPGVAE.\n4. The authors provide a clear and concise implementation of the proposed approach.\n\nWeaknesses:\n1. The authors rely on a relatively small number of experiments to demonstrate the robustness of PPGVAE.\n2. The authors do not provide a comprehensive comparison with prior methods, including a discussion of the limitations and challenges of each approach.\n3. The authors assume that the latent space of the VAE is explicitly structured by property values, which may not always be the case.\n4. The authors do not provide a clear explanation of the hyper-parameters used in the experiments, and the impact of varying these parameters on the performance of PPGVAE.\n\nSuggestions for Improvement:\n1. The authors should provide a more comprehensive set of experiments to demonstrate the robustness of PPGVAE, including experiments on a larger number of datasets and with varying levels of separation.\n2. The authors should provide a more detailed comparison with prior methods, including a discussion of the limitations and challenges of each approach.\n3. The authors should provide a clear explanation of the hyper-parameters used in the experiments, and the impact of varying these parameters on the performance of PPGVAE.\n4. The authors should consider incorporating additional exploratory mechanisms into the PPGVAE approach to improve its robustness and performance.\n\nRecommendation:\nI recommend that the authors publish their work in a reputable conference or journal. The proposed approach is novel and effective, and the authors have made a significant contribution to the field of MBO. However, the authors should be more comprehensive in their experiments and comparison with prior methods to fully demonstrate the robustness and performance of PPGVAE. With some additional work, PPGVAE has the potential to be a leading approach in the field of MBO.",
