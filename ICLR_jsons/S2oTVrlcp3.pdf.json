    "abstractText": "Recent large language models (LLMs) have demonstrated great potential toward intelligent agents and next-gen automation, but there currently lacks a systematic benchmark for evaluating LLMs\u2019 abilities as agents. We introduce SmartPlay: both a challenging benchmark and a methodology for evaluating LLMs as agents. SmartPlay consists of 6 different games, including Rock-Paper-Scissors, Tower of Hanoi, Minecraft. Each game features a unique setting, providing up to 20 evaluation settings and infinite environment variations. Each game in SmartPlay uniquely challenges a subset of 9 important capabilities of an intelligent LLM agent, including reasoning with object dependencies, planning ahead, spatial reasoning, learning from history, and understanding randomness. The distinction between the set of capabilities each game test allows us to analyze each capability separately. SmartPlay serves not only as a rigorous testing ground for evaluating the overall performance of LLM agents but also as a road-map for identifying gaps in current methodologies. We release our benchmark at github.com/microsoft/SmartPlay.",

(Laird et al., 1987; Russell, 2010) Recently, large language models (LLMs) (Smith et al., 2022; Chowdhery et al., 2022; OpenAI, 2023; Manyika; Driess et al., 2023; Touvron et al., 2023) have made remarkable progress in various tasks (Bubeck et al., 2023). Some language models demonstrate exceptional planning (Ahn et al., 2022; Wu et al., 2023b), reasoning (Wu et al., 2023a; Shinn et al., 2023), and problemsolving (Madaan et al., 2023; Kim et al., 2023) abilities, enabling the potential as generalist agents for virtual-reality (Park et al., 2023) or real-world problem-solving.\n\u2217Work done during internship at Microsoft Research. Correspondence to ywu5@andrew.cmu.edu\nSuch potential has attracted strong interest on applications where LLM systems actively invoke tools and APIs to complete a wide range of tasks goals (Significant-Gravitas; Yoheinakajima; Reworkd; Wang et al., 2023a; Qin et al., 2023), and actively interact and make changes in an environment to achieve specific results (Wang et al., 2023b;a; Wu et al., 2023b;c). LLMs as agents could be seen as an important step toward next-gen automation.\nDespite great public attention, the capabilities of LLMs as agents have not been systematically studied, partly due to the lack of standardized LLM benchmark for agent-environment interaction. Current LLM benchmarks have been designed for static knowledge and reasoning (Hendrycks et al., 2020; Liang et al., 2022; Srivastava et al., 2022a; Zhong et al., 2023), or helpful and harmless conversations (Bai et al., 2022; Zheng et al., 2023a; Dubois et al., 2023), overlooking applications to intelligent agents.\nWe note 4 key challenges for intelligent LLM agents not captured in previous benchmarks. First, lots of real-world tasks require an agent to do long-horizon planning. Second, many events are probabilistic and an intelligent agent is expected to understand the odds. Third, an intelligent agent needs spatial reasoning to understand our 3D world. Fourth, when encountered with unseen situations, an intelligent agent should be able to learn from interactions or mistakes.\nOn the other hand, games have long been identified as go-to benchmarks for intelligent generalist agents (Pell, 2011; Genesereth et al., 2005; Whiteson et al., 2010; Schaul et al., 2011; Bellemare et al., 2013; Co\u0302te\u0301 et al., 2019; Hafner, 2021; Guss et al., 2021; Fan et al., 2022). At the core of game design (Koster, 2013), successful games often involve \u201cproblem-solving\u201d, \u201ccalculation of odds\u201d, \u201cspatial reasoning\u201d, \u201cchanging difficulties\u201d, and \u201cwell-defined and quantifiable outcome\u201d, therefore offering perfect complement to existing LLM benchmarks. Finally, some game environments are procedurally generated and game states grow exponentially, making games more robust against evaluation dataset contamination as observed in recent works (Touvron et al., 2023). Experimentally, we observe LLMs struggle to memoize intermediate states of a simple 3-disk Tower of Hanoi game.\nTaking a unique agent perspective in benchmarking LLMs, we introduce SmartPlay, a benchmark from 6 distinct games augmented with language descriptors for visual observation (Figure 1), offering up to 20 different settings and infinite environment variations. Each game presents unique challenges that span multiple dimensions of intelligent agents, as detailed in Table 3. The games range in complexity, from requiring simple one-step reasoning and rule-following in Bandits, to intricate long-term planning, multi-hop dependencies, and learning from interactions in Crafter (Hafner, 2021) and Hanoi. SmartPlay engages LLM agents in both deterministic and stochastic settings, demanding skills from basic text understanding to 3D spatial reasoning.\nGames in SmartPlay have been built with well-defined objectives and evaluation metrics: completion rate, reward, score. Therefore, SmartPlay provides a fully automated pipeline to conduct standardized evaluation for LLMs.We use SmartPlay to compare the agent performance of recent LLMs, and identify several research gaps for applying LLMs as agents. We believe that SmartPlay sets a goal that is reachable in a short time-frame yet formidable to require new breakthroughs."

Hanoi presents an advanced setting for object dependency reasoning, strategic planning, and handling mistakes. Messenger puts challenge on 2D spatial reasoning, reading syntactic variations and conducting multi-hop reasoning. Meanwhile, Minecraft offers a unique challenge in 3D spatial reasoning and generalization within a procedurally generated world. We hope the SmartPlay benchmark would serve as a tool for identifying these nuanced gaps and directing future research.\nWhile each game poses its unique challenges, the SmartPlay benchmark also evaluates an agent\u2019s capability to integrate these skills. For example, Crafter stands as the most comprehensive testbed, combining long texts, multiple interactions, concurrent objectives, and error handling into a single environment. Crafter highlight the need for future research to focus not just on isolated skills, but also on combining these skills into a unified, adaptive agent."

Move n - 1 disks from the source rod to the auxiliary rod, using the destination rod as an intermediate. 2. Move the largest disk from the source rod to the destination rod. 3. Move n - 1 disks from the auxiliary rod to the destination rod, using the source rod as an intermediate.\nThe human written manual contains a description of the game set-up and allowed actions.

We experiment with 9 recent popular open-source and proprietary LLMs and report the average score in Table 2.\nOverall, GPT-4 variants significantly out performs other proprietary models, which outperform open-source models by significant margins.\nThere is still significant room for improvement for LLM as agents: Despite the impressive performance of GPT-4 variants, there is still a significant gap between GPT-4 and human baseline performance on more challenging benchmarks, with a 10% gap on 3DiskHanoi, 40% on Minecraft creative tasks, and 70% on Crafter.\nOther proprietary LLMs struggle to keep up with GPT-4: We observe a more than 20% gap between GPT-4 and other proprietary models like Claude, Bard, and text-davinci-003 across all games except Minecraft. Furthermore, on comprehensive benchmarks like Crafter, GPT-4 variants achieves 3 times higher scores than other proprietary models.\nOpen-source LLMs have a long way to go: Open-source LLMs achieves less than half the performance of GPT-4 variants on simple Bandit and Rock-Paper-Scissors tasks, and 1/8 the performance\non more challenging tasks. The fine-tuned Vicuna-13b model performs much worse than the base LLAMA-13b.\nTo offer additional insights into the individual agent capabilities of LLMs as identified in Figure 2, we compute, for each capability c, the capability score pcLLM of an LLM as the average of human normalized score sg over each game g, weighted by the degree dgc at game g presents challenge c:\npcLLM = \u2211 g d g csg\u2211\ng d g c .

We also identify that GPT-4 variants score lower on learning from interactions, error/mistake handling, and spatial reasoning.\nClaude demonstrates overall better performance than Bard, especially in planning, reasoning, instruction following. Compared to the other two proprietary models, text-davinci-003 appears biased toward learning from interaction and randomness, and is particularly weaker at instruction following, planning and reasoning.\nLLAMA-2-13b and LLAMA-1-13b performs similar on the high level, with LLAMA-2-13b performing better at planning, reasoning, and error handling, but worse in learning from randomness and interactions.

In Crafter, GPT-4 variants consistently attempts to build crafting table with 1 wood and recovers from the failure to build crafting table with 2 woods.\nData/environment contamination: For the Tower of Hanoi, it is expected that the LLMs have been trained on the exact same problem. Surprisingly, although all LLMs are able to provide the solution at the starting configuration where all disks are on the first rod (some may even write out the recurrence for the solution), most LLMs could not solve the problem and gets confused quickly after a few moves, where the disks are distributed over all three rods. We suspect that this is due to the intermediate states do not appear often in the LLM\u2019s training sets. Such observation verifies our belief that games could be more robust to dataset contamination.\nSpatial Reasoning: We observe that LLMs often have a bad sense of spatial locations and struggle with navigating to new locations. For example, in Minecraft, we often observe LLMs often take moves that are contradictory over time, i.e., a bunch of \u201cmove north\u201d followed by a bunch of \u201cmove south\u201d, undoing a lot of its own efforts at exploration."

The go-to approach for evaluating LLM for conversation is pairwise model comparison, which performs pair-wise comparison of output of the LLM and a reference LLMs to produce a ranking (Zheng et al., 2023b). The ranking was originally performed by human, but could be automated with a significantly more powerful LLM (Chiang & Lee, 2023; Zheng et al., 2023a; Dubois et al., 2023). However, such evaluation techniques depend on an expert model or human who can reliably compare the performance of different LLMs, which limits the application to SOTA LLMs like Claude-2 or GPT-4.

SmartPlay features a text game (Messenger) with procedural game rule generation (Hanjie et al., 2021) to test the generalization of the LLM agents at language understanding and planning.\nTo capture real-world challenges like spatial-reasoning, we study converting 2D/3D games into text-games. Shridhar et al. (2020b) demonstrated the possibility of converting a 3D embodied indoor environment (Shridhar et al., 2020a) into a TextWorld (Co\u0302te\u0301 et al., 2018) game by \u201clisting\u201d all the objects in text. However, such conversion relies on low-level controllers and teleportation, trivializing the environments for current LLMs (Micheli & Fleuret, 2021; Wu et al., 2023b). Therefore, we follow Wu et al. (2023c) to offer a list of objects/observations with directional relationship to the agent: \u201cto your south-east.\u201d Such description allows LLMs to make meaningful progress without low-level controllers (Wu et al., 2023c)."

            "text": "In this work, we introduce SmartPlay, both a challenging benchmark and a methodology for evaluating LLMs\u2019 performance as agents. Our initial release of SmartPlay consists of Two-armed Bandits, Rock Paper Scissors, Messenger (Hanjie et al., 2021), Crafter (Hafner, 2021), and Minecraft (Fan et al., 2022) creative navigation tasks. SmartPlay benchmarks not only basic abilities like instruction following and in-context reasoning, but also evaluates capabilities like planning, understanding of randomness, 2D/3D spatial reasoning, and error handling, which are often underrepresented in\nexisting LLM benchmarks. To achieve next-gen automation, we believe that language models should go beyond speaking fluent language (Eldan & Li, 2023), and become more intelligent agents that could interact with the world and human users. We hope that SmartPlay would catalyze research on building more capable and reliable LLM agents.\nFinally, SmartPlay offers guidelines for easily adding games to the benchmarking suite. SmartPlay will be continuously improved to provide up-to-date challenges for next-gen LLMs."

Inspired by Wu et al. (2023c), we adopt a directional visual description scheme to encode the scene observation in text. Specifically, we first run connected component algorithm to group the same blocks that are connect into groups, and then describe the group\u2019s relative position to the agent based on the closest block from the group. For example, an observation in Figure 4 will be described as:\nYou see: - grass, 3.87 blocks away to your bottom, taking 38% of screen - plant, 22.10 blocks away to your bottom-right, taking 2% of screen - water, 33.88 blocks away to your bottom-left, taking 1% of screen - wood, 18.76 blocks away to your bottom-left, taking 0% of screen - flower, 32.98 blocks away to your right, taking 0% of screen - wood, 24.50 blocks away to your left, taking 0% of screen - leaves, 11.63 blocks away to your left, taking 6% of screen - leaves, 56.55 blocks away to your right, taking 1% of screen"
